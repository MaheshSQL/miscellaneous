It also uses challenges to crowd source new ideas to help solve intractable development challenges. The innovationXchange leverages the knowledge, skills and resources of others to achieve greater impact. For example, it is working with Monash University to undertake clinical trials of a new approach for combatting the dengue and Zika viruses. With Bloomberg Philanthropies, it is helping countries collect and use better health data. Through partnerships with Google, the innovationXchange is funding pilot projects in Cambodia, India, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Vietnam to address problems such as arsenic contamination of water and the financial exclusion of the poor. In collaboration with the US-based XPRIZE and India\u2019s Tata Group, the innovationXchange is offering a US$2 million prize for the research team that can harvest 2,000 litres of clean water a day from the air, at a cost of two cents a litre, using only renewable energy.",
