            "text": "These economic, political and social changes are adding to other pressures on the international system. While the United States remains the preeminent global power and most important influence on international affairs, it now shares the stage with a number of countries with large populations and economies. Since 1950, the United States\u2019 share of the world economy has nearly halved, from 27 per cent to 15 per cent today (in purchasing power parity terms). This contrasts with China\u2019s rapid increase, growing from two per cent in 1980 to nearly 18 per cent today. As a consequence, China along with other major and emerging powers such as Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil have growing weight in international affairs. Non-state actors, such as multinational companies, civil society groups and private foundations, are also able to mobilise resources and communities of interest globally. They are increasingly able to shape international responses to issues as diverse as climate change, sustainable development, education and health standards. The net result is that global governance is becoming more complex. Many global institutions are finding it difficult to respond to the scale and complexity of international challenges. A greater number of major and emerging powers with divergent interests and values makes finding consensus difficult.",

            "text": "The international order is also being contested in other ways. Some states have increased their use of \u2018measures short of war\u2019 to pursue political and security objectives. Such measures include the use of non-state actors and other proxies, covert and paramilitary operations, economic coercion, cyber attacks, misinformation and media manipulation. In the United Nations, we have seen coordinated efforts to dilute universal human rights standards. Some states are active in asserting authoritarian models in opposition to open, democratic governance. International rules designed to help maintain peace and minimise the use of coercion are also being challenged. Australia\u2019s security is maintained primarily through our own strength, our alliance with the United States and our partnerships with other countries. Australia\u2019s security and prosperity would nonetheless suffer in a world governed by power alone. It is strongly in Australia\u2019s interests to seek to prevent the erosion of hard-won international rules and agreed norms of behaviour that promote global security. Refusal to act in ways consistent with international law and these norms, such as Russia\u2019s coercive and aggressive actions in Ukraine, Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons, and North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs, weakens global security.",

Using market exchange rates, the US economy accounted for 65.4 per cent of the global economy in 1950 and 24.7 per cent in 2016.
