            "text": "Australia is a major economic partner and an enabler of opportunity for our neighbours. Some countries in the region have the natural resources and many have the tourism potential to benefit from increased trade and investment with Australia, New Zealand and Asian economies. Our engagement is anchored in common interests. Stability in Papua New Guinea, the wider Pacific and Timor-Leste, for example, is vital to our ability to defend Australia\u2019s northern approaches, secure our borders and protect our exclusive economic zone. Most countries of the region are, however, facing acute development challenges. Small formal economies, distance from major markets, high costs, and rapidly growing populations hamper economic growth. Governance and capacity constraints in some countries also limit their ability to deliver services. These challenges make it difficult to respond to transnational crime, natural disasters, climate change or outbreaks of infectious diseases. This in turn exposes Australia to increased threats, which our cooperation helps to mitigate. To identify and implement practical responses to these economic, security and development challenges, Australia will enhance engagement with Papua New Guinea, other Pacific countries and Timor-Leste, as well as with regional organisations such as the Pacific Islands Forum. In the Pacific, Australia recognises that new approaches will be necessary. Our support will focus on three priorities: promoting economic cooperation and greater integration within the Pacific and also with the Australian and New Zealand economies, including through labour mobility tackling security challenges, with a focus on maritime issues, and strengthening people-to-people links, skills and leadership. These priorities build on our commitment to work with governments in the Pacific to respond to climate change, bolster resilience, strengthen emergency responses and improve governance, education, health and gender outcomes. No single country or organisation can tackle the challenges in the Pacific on its own. Stronger bilateral and regional partnerships are necessary to achieve shared goals.",
