The Government wants it to become a rite of passage for young Australians to live and work in our region. The NCP must be an investment that endures for the long term. Each year, the Government provides $50 million to fund about 10,000 students under the NCP. By 2018, we will have supported more than 30,000 Australian undergraduates to study and undertake internships in the Indo-Pacific (Figure 8.2). We will nurture the NCP\u2019s alumni network by linking NCP alumni to international students in Australia. Countries across the Indo-Pacific have embraced the NCP at the highest levels. The Australian business community and many foreign companies are also essential partners, including by providing internships.",

Many foreign government and business leaders, including heads of state, ministers and CEOs, have studied in Australia and understand our institutions, values and perspective on the world. This is a significant asset for Australia. These former international students, together with Australians who have studied overseas, make up Australia\u2019s global alumni community. Our strategy to build a global alumni community promotes Australia and advances our national interests. The Government is working in partnership with Australian universities to keep alumni",
