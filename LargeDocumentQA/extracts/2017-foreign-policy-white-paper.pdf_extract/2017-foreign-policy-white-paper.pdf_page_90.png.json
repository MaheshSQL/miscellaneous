Shifts in power between states, geopolitical competition and the political and economic effects of globalisation are testing its effectiveness and cohesion.",

Australia will encourage and tangibly support the leadership of the United States to this end.\n\nAustralia will also work with new and emerging powers to increase their stake in the international system. We will support, for example, well-designed proposals for new forms of global cooperation and reform of multilateral institutions.\n\nEven in a period of uncertainty and challenge, global partnerships and international cooperation will remain important to Australia for three fundamental reasons.\n\nFirst, the world\u2019s interconnectedness makes global cooperation even more important. Many problems that directly affect our interests can only be tackled through cooperation with other states.\n\nSecond, we must help shape responses to global challenges because if we do not then others will, potentially in ways that diverge from our interests and our values.\n\nThird, in many circumstances multilateral engagement magnifies our influence. By working with partners in coalitions and leveraging the resources and expertise of international organisations we can get more done.\n\nThe Government\u2019s global agenda concentrates on issues where Australia has vital security, economic and other interests, and where we are most likely to achieve results.\n\nBeyond our strong interest in open and rules-based international trade and investment (Chapter 4), Australia\u2019s priorities in the international system include:\n\n- shaping and protecting rules and norms\n- guarding against threats to international peace and security\n- protecting the international environment in a way that also allows for sustainable growth of the Australian economy\n- reducing global poverty and responding to humanitarian crises",
