We face a range of sophisticated cyber threats. Some \u2018push factors\u2019 could revitalise attempts at people smuggling to Australia on a large scale. We face challenges in dealing with attempts to interfere in the independence and sovereignty of Australian decision-making. Crime will continue to emanate from beyond our borders and will grow in complexity.\nThe Government is resolutely committed to meeting these challenges. Ensuring the safety and security of Australians is our most fundamental responsibility and highest priority. National security is the foundation on which our freedoms have been built and maintained.\nThe Government\u2019s reforms to Australia\u2019s domestic security and national intelligence arrangements reflect this commitment. In the decade ahead, Australia will need to continue building strong defences and resilient communities at home. We will take determined action internationally, in partnership with others and on our own as necessary, to disrupt and defeat these threats.",

Since the national threat level was raised in September 2014, there have been several terrorist attacks in Australia and many disrupted plots. With the threat continuing to evolve we should be prepared for more attacks. At home and abroad, the Government will continue to deploy its full range of capabilities to reduce the lure of violent extremist ideologies and the likelihood of future attacks.\nThe Government is constantly reviewing and strengthening its counter-terrorism responses because the threat we face is both enduring and dynamic. Islamist extremists globally, but crucially also in Australia and in Southeast Asia, have been energised by the fighting in Iraq and Syria. New and emerging technologies are being used to conduct attacks, enable extremist activity and spread propaganda.",
