Our trade and investment agenda will assist by boosting jobs and supporting higher living standards.\n\nIt has been 14 years since the last comprehensive white paper on Australia\u2019s international engagement. While national interests are enduring, the international environment in which we pursue them has changed significantly, and so too has Australia.\n\nWe hope that future Australian governments regularly take the opportunity to engage the Australian community on our place in the world and explain the reasons for our international engagement. For our part, the Government will keep the policy settings in this White Paper under review against a changing external environment.\n\nWe thank state and territory governments and the many individuals and organisations who made submissions to the White Paper and who engaged directly in our public consultation process.\n\nThe development of the White Paper encouraged a wide-ranging public discussion about Australia\u2019s place in the world and promoted greater understanding of our diplomatic activities and how the Government seeks to enhance Australia\u2019s security and prosperity through foreign policy.\n\nThis has been immensely valuable and we will ensure it continues.",
