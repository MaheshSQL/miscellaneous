Foreign interference goes further by using clandestine or deceptive means to affect political, governmental or even commercial processes to cause harm to Australian interests. Technology has broadened the tools available to states engaging in foreign interference. New media platforms, for example, provide opportunities to sow misinformation. The Government will act to protect the sovereignty, integrity and transparency of our institutions. We will ensure that national decision-making and institutions remain free from foreign interference. This is one of our most important national interests.",
