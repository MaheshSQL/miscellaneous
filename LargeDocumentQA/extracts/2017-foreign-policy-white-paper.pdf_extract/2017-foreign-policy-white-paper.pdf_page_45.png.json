Preventing hunger and malnutrition will remain an acute challenge.\n\nThe world\u2019s oceans will be under greater pressure. Demand for seafood, especially from Asia, will further strain global fisheries, 31 per cent of which are fished at unsustainable levels. The continuing effective management of our own fisheries will depend on the health and sustainability of ecosystems in the wider region.\n\nThe world\u2019s forests will continue to face intense pressure from land-use conversion, unsustainable harvesting (including illegal logging) and climate change. Demand for timber is expected to quadruple by 2050.\n\nAs a major exporter of food and energy, and with our world-leading expertise in agriculture, forestry, water management and environmental sciences, Australia will make an important contribution to efforts to respond to these shared challenges.",
