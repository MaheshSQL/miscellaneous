In the decade ahead, both trends will continue profoundly to influence our prosperity and security. Other major trends will shape our world, including the pace and scale of technological advances, demographic shifts, climate change and new global power balances. The threats posed by North Korea and terrorism and other transnational issues will require resolute, long-term responses. The United States remains the most powerful country but its long dominance of the international order is being challenged by other powers. A post-Cold War lull in major power rivalry has ended. These trends are converging to create an uncertain outlook for Australia.",

In the post-Second World War period, we have benefitted significantly from an international order shaped by US power and global leadership. Our world has been characterised by an increasingly integrated economy and the development of international rules and institutions. The principles embedded in the post-war order have strongly supported Australia\u2019s interests and our values. These principles include the promotion of open markets, the importance of international law and other norms to guide international cooperation, the articulation of universal rights and freedoms and the need for states to work cooperatively on global challenges. US leadership has supported global security, including through the network of US alliances and the US military presence in Asia and Europe. Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system. How the international order evolves in response has important implications for Australia.",
