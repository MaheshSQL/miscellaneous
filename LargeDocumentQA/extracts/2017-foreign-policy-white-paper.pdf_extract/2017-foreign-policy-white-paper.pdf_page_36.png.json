            "text": "We do not know yet how far these shifts will change the way nations conduct and organise themselves globally. Economies and businesses will still trade with each other. The world will remain highly interconnected. Innovation and new technology will create employment and new ways of doing business that we can only begin to imagine. International cooperation on many issues remains not only possible but essential. Much of the institutional architecture of the international order has proven resilient and is valued by countries large and small. Even so, the potential risks of the shifts described above are also clear. A more inward-looking and contested world would be less prepared to respond to major crises and work collectively to address global challenges. Multilateral institutions could see their effectiveness decline further. The rules and principles on which the international system has been built could erode. New approaches, contrary to our interests, might develop and ultimately prevail. Over time, we can also expect the nature of work to change further as more jobs\u2014or parts of more jobs\u2014are automated. Digital platforms will allow more tasks to be done anywhere in the world. Without policy responses to manage change and seize the opportunities that will come from innovation, there is a risk that income inequality in some countries could worsen. One implication is that pressures on governments to deliver access for their citizens to the benefits of national prosperity in a globalised world are unlikely to abate. Any pronounced shift towards protectionism as a result would impede flows of trade and investment, dampen economic growth and undermine the international rules that govern trade and allow economies to prosper together. It would also reduce living standards, including in Australia.",

            "text": "Economic growth in Asia continues to re-shape our strategic landscape. The compounding effect of China\u2019s growth is accelerating shifts in relative economic and strategic weight (Figure 2.4). In parts of the Indo-Pacific, including in Southeast Asia, China\u2019s power and influence are growing to match, and in some cases exceed, that of the United States. The future balance of power in the Indo-Pacific will largely depend on the actions of the United States, China and major powers such as Japan and India. The responses of major Southeast Asian states, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, will also be important. By some measures China\u2019s economy is already the largest in the world. China is the most important trading partner for most of the region\u2019s economies and a major investor, including in infrastructure. China\u2019s military modernisation is rapidly improving the capability of its armed forces. It has the largest navy and air force in Asia and the largest coast guard in the world. It is a large aid donor and lender to the region.",
