They provide a framework to guide the deployment of our resources and capabilities in pursuit of our highest foreign policy priorities.\n\nWe identify five objectives of fundamental importance to Australia\u2019s security and prosperity. The Government will:\n\n- promote an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo\u2013Pacific region in which the rights of all states are respected\n- deliver more opportunities for our businesses globally and stand against protectionism\n- ensure Australians remain safe, secure and free in the face of threats such as terrorism\n- promote and protect the international rules that support stability and prosperity and enable cooperation to tackle global challenges, and\n- step up support for a more resilient Pacific and Timor-Leste.\n\nCollectively, these priorities and the policies that support them provide a clear-eyed and active agenda for Australia\u2019s international engagement. They are bound by a common thread\u2014each seeks to respond to the opportunities and uncertainties of a contested world. In many instances, they build on current policy settings with new approaches and higher levels of activity and ambition.\n\nWhile the Indo\u2013Pacific is of primary importance to Australia, these priorities also reflect the global scope of our national interests and foreign policy.\n\nPlanning for an uncertain decade is inherently difficult. In the current environment, it is possible that some of the trends identified in this White Paper will move against Australia\u2019s interests in ways that require further responses. Agile policy and regular reviews of our foreign, defence and national security frameworks will be important.",

            "text": "Australia\u2019s interests are clear as the distribution of power in the Indo\u2013Pacific changes. We want peace to help sustain the growth that has brought the region to the centre of the global economy. Equally, we want a region where our ability to prosecute our interests freely is not constrained by the exercise of coercive power.\n\nFor Australia, the stakes could not be higher. The Indo\u2013Pacific encompasses our most important economic partners and its dynamism supports economic growth in Australia, creating jobs and increasing our standard of living.\n\nOur cultural, educational and people-to-people links are also deep. The region is the source of many of our biggest migrant communities, which are vital to our modern, vibrant nation.",
