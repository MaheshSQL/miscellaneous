By sharing our experience with economic reform, sustainable development and regulation, we help other governments with their own challenges. This enables us to collaborate with partners to tackle common problems, and promote standard setting and regulatory approaches that facilitate commercial engagement by Australian companies. Our institutions and standards in the financial sector, aged and health care, and water efficiency are among several such areas of strength for Australia. The changing world economy gives further scope for Australia to lead in the setting of global standards. Our delivery of effective development programs also adds to our reputation and helps to showcase Australia\u2019s expertise in areas such as education, health and science.",

These exchanges build influence, and strengthen people-to-people links and mutual understanding. Australia will continue to welcome hundreds of thousands of international students to our shores (Figure 8.1). For more than 60 years, the Government has supported the education of emerging leaders from developing countries. From the Colombo Plan in the 1950s to today\u2019s Australia Awards, more than 80,000 men and women have received an Australian Government scholarship to study in Australia. Each year, the Government invests approximately $320 million in the Australia Awards program, funding around 3,500 scholarships, fellowships and short courses. The challenge for Australia is to ensure we capitalise on the opportunity afforded to us in hosting\u2014often for several years\u2014some of the best and brightest from the Indo-Pacific and beyond. To that end, the Government will deliver a new Australia Awards Linkages Framework to connect awardees to leaders in the private sector and government. Endeavour Scholarships and Fellowships and Endeavour Mobility Grants also build Australia\u2019s reputation for excellence in the provision of education and research. Since 2004, tens of thousands of Australian and overseas students have benefitted from study, research or professional development under the program.",
