            "text": "Like all great powers, China will seek to influence the region to suit its own interests. As it does, a number of factors suggest we will face an increasingly complex and contested Indo-Pacific. Even as China\u2019s power grows and it competes more directly with the United States regionally and globally, the United States will, for the foreseeable future, retain its significant global lead in military and soft power. The United States will continue to be the wealthiest country in the world (measured in net asset terms), the world\u2019s leader in technology and innovation, and home to the world\u2019s deepest financial markets.\n\nThe Australian Government judges that the United States\u2019 long-term interests will anchor its economic and security engagement in the Indo-Pacific. Its major Pacific alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia will remain strong. Most regional countries, including Australia, clearly consider a significant US role in the Indo-Pacific as a stabilising influence. Japan and India, major economies and military powers in their own right, are also playing stronger roles in Indo-Pacific security and political affairs and are seeking to influence the balance of the regional order.\n\nIn this dynamic environment, competition is intensifying, over both power and the principles and values on which the regional order should be based. Maritime and land border disputes will continue to create friction. The region\u2019s seas and airspace are becoming more contested. Freedom of navigation is under challenge in parts of the region.\n\nEconomic power is also being used for strategic ends. We are already seeing increased competition over regional economic integration, including in the financing of infrastructure projects.",
