            "text": "the global order, beginning with the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. We have played a leading role in setting new rules and norms in areas as diverse as the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Arms Trade Treaty, digital trade, internet governance, global health standards and regional approaches to irregular migration and human trafficking. This gives us standing in the system that we can leverage in pursuit of our interests. To help protect and strengthen international rules and norms, Australia will: \n\n\u25aa act in partnership with other states and organisations to uphold international law \n\n\u25aa encourage others to adopt or ratify international conventions and instruments to broaden adherence to international law \n\n\u25aa support international accountability and adjudicatory mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice \n\n\u25aa continue to make a significant contribution to the development of new rules and norms, and \n\n\u25aa use our development assistance to help partner countries join and comply with international rules-based processes. \n\nThe Government is also committed to working with the United States and like-minded partners to maintain a rules-based order by making practical and meaningful military commitments where it is in our interests and capacity to do so. \n\nWhile the current international system supports Australia\u2019s national interests, the Government recognises that the way states interact has never been and never will be static. Institutions, rules and forms of cooperation can and do evolve. Australia believes the institutions that support global cooperation must accommodate the greater weight of emerging powers. Without such flexibility, new multilateral bodies might proliferate, undercutting the effectiveness of the current system and potentially challenging Australia\u2019s interests and values. \n\nAustralia will therefore contribute constructively to the reform of international institutions. We will remain open to proposals that might address gaps in the current institutional architecture. In doing so, our approach will remain anchored in international law, universal standards of human rights, good governance, transparency and accountability.",

Terrorists continue to seek WMD to cause mass casualties. Technological advances make developing bio-weapons easier and cheaper. Chemical weapons are again being used, as seen recently in Syria. Proliferation networks, including for missile technology and small arms, threaten the security of the Indo-Pacific. \n\nWe will remain vigilant in countering proliferation and ensuring effective export controls on goods and technologies used in the manufacture of WMD. We will stay",
