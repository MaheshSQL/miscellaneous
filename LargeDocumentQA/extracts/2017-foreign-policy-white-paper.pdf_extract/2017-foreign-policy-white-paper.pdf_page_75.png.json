Initiatives that reduce the regulatory burden for our services firms will assist this sector\u2019s export competitiveness, including through equivalence or harmonisation. This is vital for our agenda to grow services exports beyond education and tourism. It will enable Australian providers to operate in foreign markets in sectors such as health and aged care, financial services, communications, marketing, and engineering and design. The Government is also shaping international rule-making and standard-setting to provide the certainty and stability needed to help Australian businesses realise opportunities through digital trade. Australia\u2019s FTAs incorporate rules facilitating digital trade\u2014such as on electronic signatures and data flows\u2014as well as protecting consumer rights online. Australia also promotes international standards on digital trade that are industry-led and technology neutral. Australia works in APEC to facilitate trade through improved data standards, and by promoting standards and regulations based on science for agriculture and food safety. We have also strengthened economic and technical cooperation between regulators and agencies that set standards to promote regional economic integration. Australia has a sophisticated financial services sector, and a $2.3 trillion superannuation sector, positioning our firms to tap into rising demand in Asia for funds management products. To facilitate opportunities for Australian financial service providers, we pioneered the Asia Region Funds Passport, agreed with Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Thailand. Once implemented, the passport will allow Australian fund managers to sell investment funds in the other participating jurisdictions (and vice-versa).",

Drawing on the commercial expertise and informed by the priorities of Australian companies, our overseas network will advance our commercial interests in foreign markets, reinforcing high-level advocacy by Australian political and business leaders. Our overseas posts exchange insights with business on foreign markets and global economic conditions. They help Australian companies to navigate political and other risks and to identify commercial opportunities in unfamiliar business and regulatory environments. In partnership with business, we work to influence the policies of foreign governments to support our economic interests. We also assist Australian businesses to tackle non-tariff measures that often impede our exports. These can include regulatory barriers, standards-related measures, or labelling and customs measures.
