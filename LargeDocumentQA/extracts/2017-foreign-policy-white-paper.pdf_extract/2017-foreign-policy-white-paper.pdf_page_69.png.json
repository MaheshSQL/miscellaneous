            "text": "Australia\u2019s interests are served by global efforts to encourage sustainable development and reduce poverty (Chapter 6). The work of the World Bank\u2014the world\u2019s largest multilateral source of official development finance\u2014helps achieve these aims and supports economic growth and an open global economy. Over the past four years, Australia has contributed approximately $220 million a year to the International Development Association, the World Bank\u2019s fund for the poorest nations. In addition, we provide about $250 million a year through our development program to co-finance initiatives with the World Bank Group that align with our priorities in the Indo-Pacific. Australia also works in the OECD, the World Customs Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization and numerous other bodies to support policies, cooperation and dialogue that enable economic growth and help to facilitate trade and investment. Australia encourages reform to international institutions to make them more effective and responsive, and to better reflect the economic weight of emerging economies. This will help protect the legitimacy of institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF. Australia will also be open to new groupings and approaches to support open trade and investment based on market principles.",
