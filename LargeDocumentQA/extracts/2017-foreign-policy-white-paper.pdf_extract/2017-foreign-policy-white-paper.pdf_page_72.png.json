To open new opportunities for Australia, the Government will expand our network of agreements to ensure that by 2020 we have FTAs with countries that account for over 80 per cent of our trade.\nOur immediate priority is concluding the Indonesia \u2013 Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership. This agreement will strengthen commercial links and help stimulate increased two-way investment. Both governments want this agreement to unlock future growth opportunities for Australia and Indonesia.\nThe Government will negotiate an ambitious FTA with the European Union, the world\u2019s second-largest economy as a bloc. Australia will also negotiate a comprehensive FTA with the United Kingdom once it has left the European Union. These prospective FTAs will advance our commercial interests, especially in investment, services and agriculture. They will also signal the commitment of Australia, the European Union and the United Kingdom to a strong global trading system.\nIndia has striking economic potential with scope for sustained catch-up growth from improving productivity and harnessing",
