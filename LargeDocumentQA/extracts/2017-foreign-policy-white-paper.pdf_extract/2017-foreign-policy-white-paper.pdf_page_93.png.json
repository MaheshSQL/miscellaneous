As the world\u2019s peak body for responding to threats to international peace and security, the United Nations Security Council helps support Australian interests. We are seeking election to the Council as a non-permanent member in 2029-2030 because we believe elected members can enhance its effectiveness, as Australia did when we were on the Council in 2013-2014. This complements the other contributions Australia makes to the vital work of the United Nations, including through our assessed contributions, financial support for peacekeeping and our development assistance program. The Government recognises that many multilateral institutions have clear limitations. The United Nations system is frequently cumbersome and sometimes responds too slowly to urgent challenges. Our approach seeks to reinforce the strength, accountability and effectiveness of international institutions. We will encourage the United Nations and its agencies to better coordinate activities, reform their corporate governance and work more closely with the private sector, including by tapping into private funding. We will continue to support the current Secretary-General's efforts to reform and strengthen UN peacekeeping, peacebuilding and development systems. We particularly encourage a more coordinated focus on conflict prevention, rather than waiting for crises to develop.",

Another risk is that countries do not defend rules when they are challenged, leading to the potential erosion of global governance. Finally, new rules and norms could emerge that are not consistent with Australia\u2019s interests and values. Accordingly, the Government will place a high priority on protecting and strengthening the international rules that guide the conduct of relations between states. Strong rules that help constrain the exercise of coercive power contribute to global security. They are becoming more important to Australia as the distribution of power changes in the international system. They help reinforce other ways in which we ensure our security, notably our alliance with the United States and our own defence capabilities. International law and other norms provide a basis for the peaceful resolution of disputes, including in relation to maritime or land border disputes. International rules, such as those embodied in binding resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, also underpin collective responses to challenges such as terrorism and North Korea\u2019s proliferation of WMD. More broadly, a range of legal, regulatory and other measures support commerce, travel, investment and other exchanges. International accords such as the Paris Agreement guide global cooperation on climate change. A rules-based trading system centred on the WTO is fundamental to Australia\u2019s interests. International aviation, shipping, telecommunications, postal services and many other aspects of our world are inconceivable without the certainty and predictability inherent in a system based on rules.
