We are providing $300 million over four years to provide climate science and data and other support to help our partners plan for and adapt to climate change and mitigate its impacts. We use our own investment to leverage funding by multilateral banks in critical infrastructure. Similarly, we are working to help countries in the region access resources from the Green Climate Fund, to which Australia has contributed $200 million. We will increase investments in local and national capacity to better manage disasters in the Pacific. This will include funding experts to work with Pacific National Disaster Management Offices and support for a new partnership with Australian non-government organisations (NGOs) and the Australian Red Cross to bolster disaster preparedness and strengthen Pacific civil society. We will work with Pacific governments, the World Food Programme and United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to improve early warning systems and access to pre-positioned humanitarian supplies. We will boost joint training with emergency services, police and defence forces to improve disaster preparedness.",

We will support organisations in the region that coordinate management of natural resources such as fisheries, or provide essential scientific and technical services. Australia is committed to strong and productive relations with Fiji. We recognise Fiji\u2019s economic potential and its capacity to serve as a regional hub for business, tourism, security cooperation, and humanitarian and disaster response coordination. We will work with Solomon Islands to help ensure that the transition from RAMSI protects stability in the country. Our joint work to support economic growth and to improve governance will remain important. We will also continue to support Vanuatu\u2019s recovery from Tropical Cyclone Pam and to build resilience and growth. Australia will assist with economic and social development in Polynesia by supporting reform programs and assisting the export sector. We will work with Tonga and Samoa, including through joint security operations and exercises, and by cooperating in regional organisations. We will strengthen cooperation with the smaller island states in the region with a focus on economic growth, security, fisheries and building more resilient communities.",
