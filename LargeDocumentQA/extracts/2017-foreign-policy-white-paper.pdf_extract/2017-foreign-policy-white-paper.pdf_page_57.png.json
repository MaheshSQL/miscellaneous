Many are leaders in the design and integration of large-scale infrastructure projects. Australian financial institutions have been at the forefront of innovative financing for infrastructure, including through public private partnerships, and are able to tap into deep pools of funds for multi-billion dollar projects. Australia helps regional countries prepare high-quality, investment-ready projects and improve policy frameworks to attract private capital. We have played a key role in negotiating rules and practices that match our and the region\u2019s interests, as we did in the establishment of the AIIB. With our partners, we also support the development of infrastructure plans and the preparation, financing and implementation of projects that best meet the region\u2019s needs, including through our work with the World Bank Group and the Asian Development Bank and through our support for ASEAN\u2019s Masterplan on Connectivity.",

It has the right membership (including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia, the United States and ASEAN countries), and it has the right mandate. Leaders drive its agenda. In recent years, EAS leaders have paid increased attention to security issues such as counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism and maritime security, a trend Australia will seek to reinforce. We aim to bolster the strategic role of the EAS so that it can positively influence the region\u2019s rules and norms.",

They also strongly engage the interests of countries, such as the United States and Australia, which seek to build a region where disputes are solved peacefully and in accordance with international law. The South China Sea is a major fault line in the regional order. Australia is not a claimant state and does not take sides in the competing claims. Like other non-claimant states, however, we have a substantial interest in the stability of this crucial international waterway, and in the norms and laws that govern it. We have urged all claimants to refrain from actions that could increase tension and have called for a halt to land reclamation and construction activities.
