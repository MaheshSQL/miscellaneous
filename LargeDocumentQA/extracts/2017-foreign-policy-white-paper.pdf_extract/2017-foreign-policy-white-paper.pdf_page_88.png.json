The Government no longer provides consular assistance to Australian permanent residents (except during crises) or to dual nationals in their country of other nationality in cases where they are clearly self-sufficient. DFAT is improving its capacity to manage complex cases such as those involving mental health issues and victims of violent crime.\n\nThe Government\u2019s crisis management systems are world-class and we are committed to their further improvement. We are building stronger cooperation arrangements with key international partners to broaden our reach and extend our global capability. DFAT\u2019s new Global Watch Office delivers a 24/7 government capability to monitor and respond to international events that affect Australian interests.",
