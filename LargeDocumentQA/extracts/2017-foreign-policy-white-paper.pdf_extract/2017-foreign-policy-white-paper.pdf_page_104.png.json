The Migration Compact seeks to improve the global governance of migration and reduce the vulnerabilities of migrants. Australia works closely with a range of international organisations to protect and support refugees and displaced people, including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

It contributes to and often exacerbates a range of challenges, including poverty, weak governance and conflict and violent extremism. Australia\u2019s foreign policy pursues the empowerment of women as a top priority, including through the advocacy of our Ambassador for Women and Girls. We fund development programs that support improved access to education, sexual and reproductive health services, employment and financial services for women and girls. Working with partners, we encourage women to be leaders in their communities and parliaments. We strive to end violence against women and girls. Some of our programs include: \n\n- Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development ($320 million, 2010\u20132022), which supports women in 14 Pacific countries to participate fully and safely in political, economic and social life \n- the Investing in Women Initiative in South East Asia ($46 million, 2016\u20132019), which works with businesses to improve women\u2019s employment conditions and increase investment in women-led small to medium sized enterprises, and \n- the Australia Indonesia program for Empowering Indonesian Women for Poverty Reduction ($108.3 million, 2012\u20132020), which works to increase the participation of women in the workforce, improves access to social protection programs and empowers women to influence change at the grassroots level.",
