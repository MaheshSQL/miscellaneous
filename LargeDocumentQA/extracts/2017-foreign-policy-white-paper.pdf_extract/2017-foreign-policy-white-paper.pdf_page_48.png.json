Today, the Indo\u2013Pacific is undergoing a strategic transition as profound as the economic transformation that preceded it. No long-term foreign policy objective is more important to Australia than ensuring our region evolves peacefully and without an erosion of the fundamental principles on which the Indo\u2013Pacific\u2019s prosperity and cooperative relations are based.",

            "text": "Australia will be active in advancing and protecting our interests at this critical time. Our interests lie both in stability and in the character of the enduring peace we seek. In particular, our security and prosperity will be enhanced in a region characterised by respect for international law and other norms, and by open markets. This will help ensure Australia can prosecute our national interests unconstrained by the exercise of coercive power. Our policies to support a stable and prosperous Indo\u2013Pacific complement our trade, investment and economic engagement with the region, which is detailed in the next chapter. The Government\u2019s approach to better protecting and advancing our interests in a changing Indo\u2013Pacific begins with substantial investments in the foundations of our national strength. In particular, we are building a more capable, agile and potent Australian Defence Force. We will also pursue active diplomacy and use our development cooperation to promote economic reform and social stability. The Government will strengthen our law and justice, border protection and intelligence capabilities. Our alliance with the United States is central to Australia\u2019s security and sits at the core of our strategic and defence planning. The Government will broaden and deepen our alliance cooperation and encourage the strongest possible economic and security engagement by the United States in the region. Strengthening our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with China is also vital for Australia both to pursue extensive bilateral interests and because of China\u2019s growing influence on the regional and global issues of greatest consequence to our security and prosperity. The Government will lift the ambition of our engagement with major Indo\u2013Pacific democracies. We will do more bilaterally and work across these partnerships, including in small groups, to promote and protect a shared vision for the region and to support a balance in the region favourable to our interests. Our partnership",
