It is likely a generational endeavour. Further integrating the major economies of the Indo-Pacific serves both our economic and security interests. Australia\u2019s approach to regional trade negotiations, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), seeks to ensure that the core features of these arrangements are consistent with our goal of an open, region-wide arrangement. Much of the new competition for influence is also being played out through infrastructure development. There are several regional infrastructure and economic engagement initiatives, including ones advanced by China, India and Japan. The region\u2019s infrastructure needs are massive and wide-ranging (Figure 3.1). It is in our interests for this infrastructure to be developed in a way that conforms to the principles set out above. We also favour infrastructure that has robust social and environmental safeguards and avoids unsustainable debt burdens on the economies of the region. It is on this basis that Australia engages with regional infrastructure initiatives, including China\u2019s Belt and Road. We seek to ensure that Australian firms are well placed to prosper from the region\u2019s pipeline of future investment. Our firms have more than 30 years",
