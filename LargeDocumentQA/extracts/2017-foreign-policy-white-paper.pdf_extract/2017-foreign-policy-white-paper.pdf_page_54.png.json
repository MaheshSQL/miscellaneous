These restraints have greatly protected Australia\u2019s security interests. Australia is focused on protecting our deployed forces from a range of air and missile threats, including cruise and ballistic missile threats. At the same time, the Government keeps the possible threat of an inter-continental ballistic missile attack on Australia under constant and careful review.",

ASEAN\u2019s success has helped support regional security and prosperity for 50 years. In 2016, Australia\u2019s trade with ASEAN countries was greater than with our second-largest bilateral trading partner, the United States. Southeast Asia sits at a nexus of strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific. This both tests the region\u2019s cohesion and underlines ASEAN\u2019s central role in convening the region\u2019s strategic forums such as the EAS.",

Most economies in the Indo-Pacific require difficult-to-implement reforms to unlock the next stage of economic growth. Australia has effective institutions, regulations and standards. We have a record of economic reform that has delivered growth and jobs. We will continue to work with other countries in the region to share our technical expertise. Through our development assistance, we support the governance and stability of regional countries. We assist with efforts to boost productivity by supporting education and training. We work with partner governments to help improve investment settings, regulatory frameworks, taxation systems, management of natural resource revenues, women\u2019s participation in the workforce, and the design and management of national budgets. In APEC, we encourage countries to improve productivity, competition, good governance and market openness, including in services. Australia also funds initiatives on services, investment, competition policy and intellectual property to support the development of the ASEAN Economic Community.",
