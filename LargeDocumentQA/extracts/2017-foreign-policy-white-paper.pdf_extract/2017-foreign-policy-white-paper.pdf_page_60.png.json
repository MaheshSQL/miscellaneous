            "text": "The economic transformation of our region will continue (Chapter 2). More people moving to Asia\u2019s cities will help sustain demand for our minerals and energy. Asia\u2019s middle classes will expand and demand premium agricultural products and a wide range of services, such as education, tourism, health care and finance. Hundreds of millions of Asian consumers are already shopping online for goods and services from around the world.\n\nEstablished markets, such as those in North America, Europe and Japan, also remain important to Australia\u2019s economy, particularly as investment partners, as export markets and as a gateway to global value chains. Economic reforms in Latin America offer new possibilities for trade and investment, as do growing populations and natural resource endowments in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAt the same time, our policies will need to reflect the changing nature of trade driven by technology and shifts in the relative competitiveness of economies.\n\nLower communication and transport costs have enabled today\u2019s global value chains, in which components of goods are produced in different countries before being assembled for sale. Value chains blur the distinction between exports and imports. Goods often cross borders many times before they find their way into final products.\n\nTechnological advances will drive further change. E-commerce provides new ways to access markets and consumers. The digital economy, and the rules that govern it, is increasingly essential to Australian companies. The tasks that go into providing some services are being broken up and performed by firms in different countries in much the same way goods are produced in value chains.\n\nLower-cost robotics and technologies such as additive manufacturing are increasing opportunities for companies based in higher-wage economies, including our own.\n\nHow global manufacturing and global value chains evolve will have major implications for trade and investment. Given its central role in manufacturing, changes in China\u2019s economy will be influential. As its economy becomes more advanced, production of many goods could be centralised in China. Conversely, higher costs in China might see companies shift production to other countries to seek competitive advantages.\n\nGlobal developments in energy technology and consumption will influence demand for major Australian exports like iron ore, coal and LNG. The increasing use of high efficiency, low-emission coal technologies, cleaner gas plants and advances in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage technologies will create export and investment",
