While this offers potential for growth, a more diverse economy also focused on agriculture, fisheries, services and tourism, as well as better governance, will be essential for Papua New Guinea to convert its natural endowments into sustained, broad-based economic growth. Papua New Guinea continues to face serious development challenges. Its population of about 8 million\u201440 per cent under the age of 15\u2014is projected to reach 18 million by 2050. The delivery of services is suffering because of a shortage of capacity and a constrained budget. Many development indicators\u2014such as maternal, child and infant mortality, the rate of communicable diseases, and access to clean water and sanitation\u2014are poor. Reflecting its challenges and the closeness of our relationship, Papua New Guinea is our largest development partner, with Australia investing around $550 million a year in assistance. We work together to encourage economic growth, improve governance, and support health and education. Australia is also helping Papua New Guinea to empower women and foster a new generation of leaders. Australia will continue to support the Papua New Guinea and autonomous Bougainville governments to implement the 2001 Peace Agreement, which underpins peace and stability in Bougainville.",

Growth is constrained for most countries because of a combination of remoteness from markets, limited land and resource bases, the dispersal of people over many islands and environmental fragility. When in force, the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus will lay the ground for stronger trade and investment, increasing business confidence through transparent and enforceable rules. Australia will work to improve opportunities for growth and jobs and to strengthen the economic resilience of the region by increasing opportunities for labour mobility to satisfy unmet demand in our labour market, investing in skills, and helping countries to capture growth potential in sectors such as tourism. Australia and the Pacific can also share institutions and systems to help bring efficiencies and economies of scale. As a first step, we will facilitate access for Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu to use Australian testing services to improve the quality and reliability of pharmaceuticals. Our new Pacific Labour Scheme will allow workers from the region to take up non-seasonal low and semi-skilled work",
