Scientific and technological advances and the speed with which ideas and knowledge can be transmitted have driven economic growth and helped millions of people live longer and better lives. Australia and Australians will have great opportunities to prosper.\n\nAt the same time, concerns about globalisation and levels of political alienation and economic nationalism in many countries are on the rise. The same connectedness that empowers individual citizens increases risk and volatility in the international system. Similarly, it amplifies the reach and impact of non-state actors, including those who would do us harm.\n\nIn the Indo\u2013Pacific, the economic growth that has come with globalisation is in turn changing power balances. The United States has been the dominant power in our region throughout Australia\u2019s post-Second World War history. Today, China is challenging America\u2019s position.\n\nAustralia and our regional and global partners face a diverse range of security threats, from North Korea\u2019s long-range missile and nuclear programs to Islamist terrorism.",

In particular, the stability of the Indo\u2013Pacific region, which has underpinned its economic transformation, cannot be assumed.\n\nAny significant rise in protectionism globally could create strategic friction, damage economic growth and undermine the rules that support flows of trade and investment.\n\nSimilarly, the rules and institutions that help maintain peace and security and guide global cooperation are under strain. In some cases, major powers are ignoring or undermining international law. With many divergent interests and shifts in power between states, it is more difficult to get governments to respond collectively to some security and economic challenges.
