The strong trend towards urbanisation will continue, including in the Indo-Pacific (Figure 2.7), bringing export opportunities for Australian minerals and energy, and other goods and services. According to United Nations estimates, globally there could be 41 mega-cities (cities with more than 10 million inhabitants) by 2030. Increased flows of displaced people and irregular migration will continue to present challenges.

The scale of this challenge is overwhelming traditional responses, requiring new approaches to supporting displaced people as well as countries of first refuge. Irregular migration will continue, with implications for the management of our borders. These movements are often enabled by digital communication, cheap transport and people smuggling syndicates. Societies that protect human rights and gender equality are much more likely to be productive and stable. In this respect, global trends are uneven. Severe gender inequality persists in parts of the Middle East, South Asia and the Pacific, undercutting social stability and economic development in these regions.",
