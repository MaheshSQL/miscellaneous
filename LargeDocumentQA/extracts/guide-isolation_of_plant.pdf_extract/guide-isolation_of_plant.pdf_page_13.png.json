This is particularly important with electrical capacitors, springs and gases under pressure, such as in suspension systems. Static electricity can be dissipated via an earth to the ground.",

This type of energy source cannot simply be turned off. The energy must be dissipated or controlled. When the potential energy is related to gravity, the plant must be allowed to \u2018complete its stroke\u2019 or \u2018come to rest\u2019 so that gravity has no further influence. Where this is not appropriate, it may be necessary to prevent movement by blocking, wedging or propping. The \u2018authorised person\u2019 should ensure props, blocks or wedges cannot be inadvertently removed. It may be possible to secure them with some type of locking system, including tagging.",

            "text": "A wide range of devices is available for locking out energy sources and other hazards that could pose a risk to people working on plant. These include switches with a built-in lock and lockouts for circuit breakers, fuses and all types of valves. Also readily available are chains, safety lockout jaws (sometimes called hasps) accommodating a number of padlocks, and sets of robust safety padlocks. Only devices that incorporate a lock or can accommodate one or more padlocks are suitable lockout devices. If more than one person is working on the same plant, each person must attach their own lock to prevent the isolator being opened before all locks have been removed or opened. The isolation procedure should identify common lock out points to ensure energy cannot be restored while someone is still working on the plant. Whatever locking device is used, it must function properly in the particular environment in which the work is undertaken. An example is lockout devices used in dusty or wet environments, as not all of them are dust or water proof and may fail under such conditions. Dust and water proof lockout devices are available from distributors of industrial safety equipment.",

It outlines the legislative framework, principles, and procedures for isolating plant, emphasizing strict adherence and risk management. The document details steps for isolating various energy sources, including electrical, fluid, steam, and pneumatic energy, and highlights the use of lockout and tagging systems. It also covers the responsibilities of employers and workers under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 and provides references for further information and resources.",
