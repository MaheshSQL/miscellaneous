This should be done by a person familiar with the plant or parts of the plant, including control stations and computers remote from the plant, to ensure isolation procedures have been effective. It is not safe to assume an isolator has locked out an electricity source simply because it is in an open position. While normally this should open an air gap between contact points, it is possible for contact points to become welded together by the passage of electricity, and remain so even when the isolator appears to be open. The calibration of any instruments required to test isolation procedure should be checked before use. Work on the plant should not begin until the authorised person confirms it is safe to do so.",
