It outlines legislative frameworks, basic principles, and procedures for isolating plant, including risk management and alternative measures when isolation is not practicable. The document emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to isolation procedures and provides detailed steps for identifying and managing energy sources and other hazards. It also outlines the responsibilities of employers and workers under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984, and includes information on various isolation devices, tagging systems, and procedures for safely de-energizing equipment, along with additional resources and contact information for further assistance.",
