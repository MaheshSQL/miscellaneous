Only people with the right skills should develop these procedures.\n\nThe procedures should be developed in consultation with safety and health representatives, people doing adjustments, cleaning, maintenance, repairs or inspections and, if possible, plant manufacturers, suppliers and people who designed and installed the plant. Where practical, people experienced in operating the plant should also be consulted.\n\nThe effectiveness of isolation procedures relies on providing workers involved with the plant with information, instruction and training, and appointing an authorised person to supervise and ensure isolation procedures are rigorously applied.\n\nThe isolation procedure should be displayed in a prominent position on or adjacent to the plant where possible.",

It outlines legislative frameworks, basic principles, and procedures for isolating plant, including risk management and alternative measures when isolation is not practicable. The document emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to isolation procedures and provides detailed steps for identifying and managing energy sources and other hazards. It also outlines the responsibilities of employers and workers under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984, and includes information on various isolation devices, tagging systems, and procedures for safely de-energizing equipment, along with additional resources and contact information for further assistance.",
