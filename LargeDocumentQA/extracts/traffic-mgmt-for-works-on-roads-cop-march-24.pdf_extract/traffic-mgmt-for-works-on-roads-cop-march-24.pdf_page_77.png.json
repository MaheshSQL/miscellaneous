This should be a minimum of 4 seconds of travel at respective operating speeds prior to the point where the work vehicle will enter the freeway.\n\u2022 The design of access points should be based on the size and weight of the vehicles accessing the worksite (as per Austroads Guide to Road Design) or additional special access points should be provided.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
