This should be a minimum of 4 seconds of travel at respective operating speeds prior to the point where the work vehicle will enter the freeway.\n\u2022 The design of access points should be based on the size and weight of the vehicles accessing the worksite (as per Austroads Guide to Road Design) or additional special access points should be provided.",

    "document_summary": "The 'Traffic Management for Works on Roads: Code of Practice' by Main Roads Western Australia provides comprehensive guidelines for managing traffic during road works to ensure the safety of workers and road users. It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
