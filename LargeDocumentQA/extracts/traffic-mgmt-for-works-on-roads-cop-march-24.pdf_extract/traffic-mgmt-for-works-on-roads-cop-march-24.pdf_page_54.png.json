Determine the hourly traffic volume in the direction of travel at the time of the works14;\n2. Divide the hourly traffic volume by 60 to determine the vehicles expected every minute;\n3. Determine the length of time to the nearest minute that vehicles will be required to stop (this includes stop time for work reasons and clearance times);\n4. Multiply this number by the vehicles expected per minute (i.e. vehicles per minute X number of minutes);\n5. Determine the types of vehicles that will be using the road and multiply its length by the number (include a 3 m space between each vehicle):\n\nNote: When determining expected queue length any decimals should be round up e.g. if it calculated that 1.5 trucks will be stopped during the stopping time, this should be round up to 2 trucks (i.e. there cannot be half a truck in the queue).",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
