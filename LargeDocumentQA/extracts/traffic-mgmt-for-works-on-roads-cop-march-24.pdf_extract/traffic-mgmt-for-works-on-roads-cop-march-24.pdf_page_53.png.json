A temporary STOP line must also be considered at this location using temporary removable road marking tape. There should be adequate distance between the PTCD/traffic controller position and the traffic control taper to ensure it can be safely negotiated by all vehicles, considering swept paths of large vehicles.\n\nSection 4.8 of AGTTM Part 3, recommends four cones be placed on the centreline from the STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL or STOP HERE WHEN DIRECTED sign position, which is encouraged, however where supported by a site-specific risk assessment these cones may be omitted.\n\nIt is recognised that there is often limited space on some local roads due to things such as parked cars, footpaths, works occurring close to intersections, etc. The Worker (symbolic) and Traffic Controller (symbolic) signs may be used in the same MMS panel where all the following requirements are met:\n\n\u2022 The road is a low-speed local road (permanent speed 60 km/h or below);\n\u2022 There are site constraints which do not allow the signs to be separated;\n\u2022 The signs are used with the MMS-ADV-26 PREPARE TO STOP sign;\n\u2022 The Traffic Controller (symbolic) sign (MMS-ADV-47) must be positioned closest to the traffic;\n\u2022 The signs must be duplicated on both sides of the road or carriageway;\n\u2022 The signs must only be displayed when the need exists and removed or replaced when workers are not visible and/or there is no Traffic Controller requiring road users to stop.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
