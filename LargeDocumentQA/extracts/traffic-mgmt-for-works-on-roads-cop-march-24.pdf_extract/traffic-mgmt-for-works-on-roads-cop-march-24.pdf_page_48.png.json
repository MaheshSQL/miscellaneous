            "text": "When preparing a TMP the allowable traffic speed will be determined by various factors including the distance of separation between workers and moving traffic. Site constraints will often limit the available distance, which in turn necessitates the lowering of traffic speed limits. Note: Where the temporary speed limit for a project is increased in order to comply with this requirement, then all elements of the traffic management must be designed for the higher limit. For example, the temporary speed limit may require a greater separation between workers and traffic or the installation of an appropriate roadworks road safety barrier system.",

            "text": "Within a long-term work project, it is accepted there will be short periods where speed limits lower than Table 7 may be required to carry out unavoidable high-risk tasks. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, activities such as setting out/ removing barriers, setup/ takedown of traffic management or work vehicles exiting the worksite into free-flowing traffic. In these circumstances, a temporarily reduced limit of 60 km/h or 40 km/h may be warranted where the lower speed limit is only applied while the high-risk activity is taking place (e.g. where unprotected workers are required to be within 3m of traffic). Where the lower speed limit is needed often the use of electronic speed signs that can be changed remotely should be considered. It is not necessary to apply to Main Roads for a variation to standards in these circumstances if efforts are made to ensure these temporary reductions are kept to a minimum and/or conducted outside of peak periods wherever possible. See section 4.2.3 if reducing traffic speeds to 40 km/h on high speed high volume roads.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
