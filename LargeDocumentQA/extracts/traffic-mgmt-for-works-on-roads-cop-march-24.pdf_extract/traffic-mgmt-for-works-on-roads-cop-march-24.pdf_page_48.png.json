Site constraints will often limit the available distance, which in turn necessitates the lowering of traffic speed limits.\n\nNote: Where the temporary speed limit for a project is increased in order to comply with this requirement, then all elements of the traffic management must be designed for the higher limit. For example, the temporary speed limit may require a greater separation between workers and traffic or the installation of an appropriate roadworks road safety barrier system.",

In these circumstances, a temporarily reduced limit of 60 km/h or 40 km/h may be warranted where the lower speed limit is only applied while the high-risk activity is taking place (e.g. where unprotected workers are required to be within 3m of traffic).\n\nWhere the lower speed limit is needed often the use of electronic speed signs that can be changed remotely should be considered.\n\nIt is not necessary to apply to Main Roads for a variation to standards in these circumstances if efforts are made to ensure these temporary reductions are kept to a minimum and/or conducted outside of peak periods wherever possible.\n\nSee section 4.2.3 if reducing traffic speeds to 40 km/h on high speed high volume roads.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
