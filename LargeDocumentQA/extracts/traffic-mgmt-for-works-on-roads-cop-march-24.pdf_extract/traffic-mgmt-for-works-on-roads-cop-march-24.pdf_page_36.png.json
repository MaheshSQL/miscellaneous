            "text": "It is a requirement that any party undertaking work on or alongside a road, must keep a copy of the current approved TMP onsite. Daily records of the sign arrangement or traffic guidance scheme must be kept in a diary in accordance with AGTTM Part 6: Field Staff \u2014 Implementation. As a minimum, the Daily Diary must be based on the Daily Diary Template on the Main Roads website www.mainroads.wa.gov.au; go to Technical & Commercial\u2019 > \u2018Working on Roads\u2019\n\nDue to the availability of smart phones and video cameras, when conducting workplace inspections and/or altering the traffic guidance scheme, video evidence should be considered (to support written documented records).\n\nAs of 1 January 2025, any organisation implementing temporary traffic management on a Main Roads worksite must conduct video drive throughs (using a Dash Cam or similar) as per the inspection schedule, to record the implemented traffic guidance scheme. This video9 must be stored for a period of 7 days and provided to Main Roads when or if requested. This does not apply to Short Term Low Impact Worksites as per AGTTM Part 5 or Mobile Works as per AGTTM Part 4.\n\nClaims for damages are often made a considerable time after an incident. Under the Limitation Act (WA), claims for negligence must be commenced within six (6) years. However, a defendant may be unaware that an action has commenced for a further year as the plaintiff has this time in which to serve the writ.\n\nMain Roads recommends that traffic management records be securely stored for a period of not less than seven (7) years from the date of completion of the works. The Authorised Body that grants approval to a Traffic Management Plan should keep a copy of the approved Traffic Management Plan and any daily records of their supervisory staff that capture the on-going implementation of the Traffic Management Plan.",
