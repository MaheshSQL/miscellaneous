Where these maximum volumes are present at long-term work sites there will be a need to precisely calculate capacity to ensure that traffic demand can be met. Site-specific calculations are needed to show the relationship between traffic density and the ability of motorists to maintain speed. Site-specific variables need to be considered in the calculations such as lane width, alignment, surface condition and heavy vehicle mix etc. In part, this assessment is necessary to ensure traffic speed through the site is not constrained through the sheer traffic volume or.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
