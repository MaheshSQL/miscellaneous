Where these maximum volumes are present at long-term work sites there will be a need to precisely calculate capacity to ensure that traffic demand can be met. Site-specific calculations are needed to show the relationship between traffic density and the ability of motorists to maintain speed. Site-specific variables need to be considered in the calculations such as lane width, alignment, surface condition and heavy vehicle mix etc. In part, this assessment is necessary to ensure traffic speed through the site is not constrained through the sheer traffic volume or.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
