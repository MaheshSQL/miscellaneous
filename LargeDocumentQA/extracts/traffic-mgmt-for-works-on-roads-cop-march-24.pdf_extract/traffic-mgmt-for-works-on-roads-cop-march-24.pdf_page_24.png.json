Traffic management planning should be undertaken in accordance with the AGTTM Part 2: Traffic Management Planning.\n\nTo ensure a consistent approach is taken when developing a TMP one of the Main Roads TMP templates' (see here) must be used as a basis for the development of the plan. Any section headings that are not applicable to the TMP being developed must be kept in the document and noted as not applicable (with the intent of keeping the TMP section numbers the same throughout all TMPs).\n\nFor longer term projects with multiple stages and/or activities it is best practice to develop an overarching Project Traffic Management Plan which can cover overall scope of works, staging, project objectives, risk management, traffic analysis, communication plan, etc. and have specific TMPs for specific work activities or stages. The TMPs that sit under the overarching Project TMP must use the TMP template that retains section headings (where information is captured elsewhere this can be referred to rather than it being replicated).\n\nAll TMPs must be prepared by a person holding Main Roads accreditation in Advanced Worksite Traffic Management (AWTM). A person holding Main Roads accreditation in Worksite Traffic Management (WTM) may make on-site modifications to the TMP in accordance with its scope and objectives (following any modification the residual risk must not be higher to workers or road users). Further information regarding requirements for WTM / AWTM tasks and accreditation is provided in section 8.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
