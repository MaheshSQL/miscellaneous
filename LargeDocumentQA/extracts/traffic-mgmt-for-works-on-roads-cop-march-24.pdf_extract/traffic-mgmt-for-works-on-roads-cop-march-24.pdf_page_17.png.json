While all works on roads are considered high risk, the categorisation into three categories allows design practices and training to be tailored to the different risk levels at each category.\n\nSee AGTTM Part 8 for more details.\n\nThe WA road network is yet to be categorised, this will be done in consultation with Road Authorities prior to the tiered approach to training and company prequalification being rolled out. Unless this Code states otherwise any recommendations or requirements within AGTTM based on road categories should be considered as a guide.\n\nAustroads National Training Framework for TTM\nThe national training framework is not currently adopted in WA, refer to section 8 for WA training and accreditation requirements.\n\nDetails of the National Austroads Training Framework are within AGTTM Part 8 and the Austroads website.\n\nFurther consultation will be undertaken with Austroads, training providers and industry in WA.",
