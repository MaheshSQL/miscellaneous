For example, use of permanent posts for the ROADWORK AHEAD and initial speed reduction signs required for the entire duration of the project but temporary sign legs for the traffic control warning signs that need to be removed and/or relocated throughout the works.\n\nIf a sign has fallen over, measures must be taken to stop this from reoccurring. This may include weighing down the legs, safely fastening the device to suitable objects or post mounting the sign.\n\nNote: Project / Contract Managers should ensure the above is considered in contract documentation, ensuring appropriate resources and personnel are provided for the required method of installation and monitoring.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
