For example, use of permanent posts for the ROADWORK AHEAD and initial speed reduction signs required for the entire duration of the project but temporary sign legs for the traffic control warning signs that need to be removed and/or relocated throughout the works.\n\nIf a sign has fallen over, measures must be taken to stop this from reoccurring. This may include weighing down the legs, safely fastening the device to suitable objects or post mounting the sign.\n\nNote: Project / Contract Managers should ensure the above is considered in contract documentation, ensuring appropriate resources and personnel are provided for the required method of installation and monitoring.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
