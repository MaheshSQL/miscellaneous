            "text": "Typically, the proposed works and staging should be determined and approved in principle prior to any TMP being produced. Once in principle approval for the works has been obtained, the TMP designer should gain a comprehensive understanding of the project staging and then an appropriate TMP can be produced. The TMP should be reviewed by the construction / project manager for suitability prior to being submitted to Main Roads to review and authorise. Depending on the complexity of the project, the time allowed for Main Roads to review should be approximately 15 working days. For works at traffic signals refer to section 2.3. Further information on preparing TMPs is provided in section 4.2. Main Roads requires submission of a TMP with all applications to work within its road reserves. TMPs for the metropolitan area must be sent to enquiries@mainroads.wa.gov.au. If the works are occurring outside the metropolitan area TMPs must be submitted to the relevant regional office using the generic email address in Appendix 4. Main Roads will, as it considers necessary, conduct audits of TMPs and refer those that do not comply with the requirements of this Code, back to the proponent for submission of an acceptable TMP prior to allowing commencement of works. Any organisations with statutory authority to enter Main Roads road reserves in emergency situations must advise the Main Roads Customer Information Centre (Ph. 138 138) of their work either prior to, or as soon as possible after commencing any emergency service.",
