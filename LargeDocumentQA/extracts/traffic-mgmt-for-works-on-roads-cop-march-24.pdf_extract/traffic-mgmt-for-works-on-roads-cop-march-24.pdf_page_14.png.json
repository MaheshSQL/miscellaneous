            "text": "This Code of Practice (herein after referred to as the \u2018Code\u2019) describes the Main Roads Western Australia\u2019s (Main Roads) requirements for managing traffic at work sites on roads. It requires traffic management for works on roads to be based on the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (AGTTM) and AS 1742.3\u20132019, unless otherwise specified by a requirement in this Code. In the event that there is a conflict between this Code and AGTTM or AS 1742.3 \u2013 2019, the Code must take precedence.\n\nThe purpose of this Code is to specify any variations or additional requirements to AGTTM and AS 1742.3 \u2013 2019 which are required at works on roads in Western Australia.\n\nThe prescribed practices are the minimum requirements, on which the Traffic Management Plans (TMPs) for all Western Australian roads must be based. Main Roads recognises that situations sometimes arise where application of these requirements is not appropriate and that variation to these requirements will be necessary. When it becomes apparent that deviation is necessary from the requirements of this Code, persons arranging the works should carefully consider all possible options, using common sense and judgment based on \u2018risk management\u2019 carried out in accordance with sections 4.3 and 4.5. Further, they must ensure that their actions are consistent with related legislation.\n\nSee AGTTM Part 1 for more details on Temporary Traffic Management (TTM) purpose, philosophy and principles.\n\nPractitioners should be aware of the document titled Traffic Management for Events Code of Practice that has been placed on Main Roads\u2019 website - see \u2018Technical and Commercial\u2019 > \u2018Working on roads\u2019. This document has been designed to complement the Traffic Management for Works on Roads Code of Practice in respect to the various traffic management issues that are common to works on roads and to events, particularly in respect to the design and implementation of Traffic Management Plans.",
