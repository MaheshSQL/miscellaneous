A shadow vehicle should also be considered at static worksites when workers on foot are in close proximity to traffic e.g. to protect workers within 3 m of live traffic.\n\nShadow vehicles must be used to protect workers on foot (when not protected by Road Safety Barriers) in the scenarios outlined in the table below on Main Roads roads with the following traffic volumes:\n\u2022 All work on roads with traffic volumes that exceed 15,000 vpd (AADT); OR\n\u2022 Night works on roads that exceed 2,000 vpd (AADT)\n\nScenario 1 - Activities / Works within a traffic lane (open or closed)\n\nScenario 2 - Activities / Works within 2 m of the live traffic lane on roads with a permanent speed limit of 80 km/h or more\n\nScenario 3 - Implementing or removing traffic management on roads with a speed limit less than 80 km/h.

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
