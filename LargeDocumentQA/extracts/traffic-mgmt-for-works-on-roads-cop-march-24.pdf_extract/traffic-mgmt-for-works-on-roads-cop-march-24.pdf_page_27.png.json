            "text": "vii. Plans that will redistribute traffic, significantly lowering the level of service and safety of the surrounding road network, including isolated intersections.\nviii. Any other situation where the road authority or authorised body consider the traffic arrangement sufficiently complex to warrant RTM review and endorsement.\nix. Any plan that requires a 40 km/h temporary speed limit on roads that meet all the following:\n1. Occurs on a multilane road; and\n2. Occurs on Freeway or road with a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or more (or a section of these roads where the speed limit is reduced due to traffic signals); and\n3. Has a traffic volume of 15,000 vpd or more.\n\nTMPs for works involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 must be reviewed and endorsed by a Roadworks Traffic Manager (RTM) in the form of their signature, the date, printed name and RTM accreditation number. Further information regarding requirements for RTM accreditation is provided in section 8.\n\nTMPs for works involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 that have been prepared by a person holding RTM accreditation must be reviewed and endorsed by another person with RTM accreditation.\n\nRTMs must only endorse finalised Traffic Management Plans that include a documented risk assessment of the proposed works in accordance with Section 4.3 and Appendix 2 of this Code, during the planning stage. A TMP must not contain a residual risk rating VH (very high-risk) for any proposed traffic management treatment. A TMP involving a residual risk rating H (high-risk) must be reviewed and endorsed by an RTM.\n\nRegardless of whether a particular TMP involves \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 or not, the Road Authority/Authorised Body that grants approval for the works to proceed may determine that the TMP requires to be endorsed by an RTM.\n\nTraffic management sites involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 on Main Roads controlled roads, must have at least one person with either Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced Worksite Traffic Management accreditation on-site at all times when road workers are present.\n\nWith the exception of repositioning of traffic control devices within the allowable tolerances specified in AGTTM, where any on-site changes to a TMP involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 as determined in the planning stage are proposed, such changes must be subject to a risk assessment using the same methodology documented in the TMP (unless an alternative methodology has been specified in the TMP). The risk assessment must be undertaken by a person holding current Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced Worksite Traffic Management accreditation. These changes must be within the scope and objectives of the TMP, anything outside this will need to be endorsed by the RTM and authorised by the relevant road authority.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures.
