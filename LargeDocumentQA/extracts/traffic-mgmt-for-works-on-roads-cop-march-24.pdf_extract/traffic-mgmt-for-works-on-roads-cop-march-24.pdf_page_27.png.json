A TMP must not contain a residual risk rating VH (very high-risk) for any proposed traffic management treatment. A TMP involving a residual risk rating H (high-risk) must be reviewed and endorsed by an RTM.\nRegardless of whether a particular TMP involves \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 or not, the Road Authority/Authorised Body that grants approval for the works to proceed may determine that the TMP requires to be endorsed by an RTM.\nTraffic management sites involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 on Main Roads controlled roads, must have at least one person with either Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced Worksite Traffic Management accreditation on-site at all times when road workers are present.\nWith the exception of repositioning of traffic control devices within the allowable tolerances specified in AGTTM, where any on-site changes to a TMP involving \u2018complex traffic arrangements\u2019 as determined in the planning stage are proposed, such changes must be subject to a risk assessment using the same methodology documented in the TMP (unless an alternative methodology has been specified in the TMP). The risk assessment must be undertaken by a person holding current Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced Worksite Traffic Management accreditation. These changes must be within the scope and objectives of the TMP, anything outside this will need to be endorsed by the RTM and authorised by the relevant road authority.",
