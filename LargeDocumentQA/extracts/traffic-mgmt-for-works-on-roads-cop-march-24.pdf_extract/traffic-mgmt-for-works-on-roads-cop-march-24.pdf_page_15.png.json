This guidance material has now been substantially transferred into the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (AGTTM) with an expansion to the guidance material based on information from Austroads member organisations.\n\nThe Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (AGTTM) is a set of comprehensive Austroads publications developed to provide a best practice reference for the development of safe, cost effective and efficient Temporary Traffic Management (TTM) solutions for Australia and New Zealand. Comprised of 10 parts, AGTTM is now freely available on the Austroads website (www.austroads.com.au go to \u2018Transport Network Operations\u2019 > \u2018Temporary Traffic Management\u2019).\n\nAGTTM version 1.1 has now been adopted in Western Australia. Note: no changes were made to AGTTM Part 8.",
