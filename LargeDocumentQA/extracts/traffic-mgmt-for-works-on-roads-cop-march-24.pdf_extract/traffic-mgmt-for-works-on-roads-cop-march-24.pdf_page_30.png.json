Refer to the AGTTM series for additional guidance.\n\nThe following must be considered when undertaking the risk management process for any activities on or near roads:\n\n\u2022 the Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022 identify construction work on or near roads as high-risk construction work,\n\u2022 A Safe Work Method Statement must be prepared before high-risk construction work commences (as per WHS Regulations),\n\u2022 AGTTM indicates that all works on roads are considered high risk,\n\u2022 Main Roads has corporately identified worker interaction with live traffic as a critical risk,\n\u2022 Obligations of the PCBU to manage risks to health and safety in accordance with Part 3.1 of the Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022:\no Duty to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards; and\no eliminate risks to health and safety so far as is reasonably practicable; and\no if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate risks to health and safety \u2013 minimise those risks so far as is reasonably practicable, through:\n\u25aa implementing the hierarchy of controls; and\n\u25aa monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the control measures.\n\nTaking this into account it would usually be expected that the pre-treatment risk ratings for works (including traffic management set up and pack down8) near live traffic would have a pre-treatment risk rating of high or greater, i.e. it is recognised that it is possible that workers may suffer major injuries or severe permanent disablement when working near traffic with no treatments or controls in place (e.g. engineering, administrative, PPE, etc.). Ensure current Main Roads\u2019 risk classification table is used and the alphanumeric codes from Table A2-4 are included as per the example below.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
