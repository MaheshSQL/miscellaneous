In July 2022 the Austroads Innovative Temporary Traffic Management Device and Solution Assessment (AITDSA) Scheme was launched, see information on the Austroads website: Austroads Innovative Temporary Traffic Management Device and Solution Assessment (AITDSA) Scheme | Austroads\n\nThis scheme provides a way for all emerging TTM devices to be assessed and recommended for use across Australia and New Zealand.\n\nMain Roads (along with all other state and territory transport agencies) is a member of the AITDSA Panel and expects all new TTM devices to be assessed through this scheme.\n\nA list of recently approved devices and associated guidelines for use can be found on the Main Roads website, go to www.mainroads.wa.gov.au > 'Technical & Commercial > 'Working on roads'.",
