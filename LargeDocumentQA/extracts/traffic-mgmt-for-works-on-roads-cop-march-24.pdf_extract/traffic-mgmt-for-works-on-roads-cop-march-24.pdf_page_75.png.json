For this reason, the taper lengths specified in Table 5.7 of AGTTM Part 3 are to be increased at long term works on high volume State Roads with a roadwork speed limit \u2265 80 km/h. Lateral shift tapers should not be less than 1:40 and merge tapers no less than 1:50. For example, a lane requiring a 3.2m lateral shift will require a taper length of at least 128m and 3.2m wide merged lanes will require a merge taper of at least 160m.",

The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
