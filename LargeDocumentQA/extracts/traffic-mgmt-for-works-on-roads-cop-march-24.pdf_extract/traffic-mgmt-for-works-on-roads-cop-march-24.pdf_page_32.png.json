            "text": "Children\u2019s crossings in Western Australia are installed under the approval of a State Government appointed committee known as the Children\u2019s Crossings and Road Safety Committee. Once approved, Main Roads and the relevant local government install children\u2019s crossing infrastructure to strict guidelines. Unless in an emergency, under no circumstance must a children\u2019s crossing be closed, moved or interfered with for the purpose of any works without seeking advice from the Children\u2019s Crossing and Road Safety Committee via the Western Australia Police Children\u2019s Crossing Unit.\n\nWhere works are located within a School Zone, consideration must be given to undertake the works outside the period indicated on the school zone sign or in school holidays. Where this cannot be done OR where a children\u2019s crossing is located within a roadwork\u2019s site, the following actions must be taken:\n\n\u2022 Consult with the Western Australian Police Children\u2019s Crossing Unit at the planning stage to agree on and finalise arrangements for the safe passage of school children and pedestrians.\n\n\u2022 Ensure the speed shown on the temporary speed zone and termination signage is less than or equal to the speed shown on the school zone sign during the school zone operating times. In cases where the worksite extends beyond the school zone, termination signage must reflect the posted speed applicable to that section of road.\n\n\u2022 Where the children\u2019s crossing stop line and side bollard have been removed as part of the roadworks, traffic controllers must be positioned at the location of the children\u2019s crossing stop line(s) to guide vehicles where to stop on the approach side of the children\u2019s crossing.\n\n\u2022 Where roadworks alters normal traffic paths during the operating times of a children\u2019s crossing, traffic controllers must assist the Traffic Warden to control vehicles and pedestrians at the children\u2019s crossing as required. If a Traffic Warden is not available, the crossing cannot be managed as a children\u2019s crossing. However, Main Roads accredited traffic controllers may be utilised to ensure the safe operation of the crossing in the same manner as other priority pedestrian crossings are temporarily managed.\n\n\u2022 Provisions for pedestrian and bicycle facilities must be in accordance with AGTTM.",
