            "text": "Temporary Road Safety Barriers help protect road workers and road users from hazards, however the barriers themselves can also present a hazard to road users. Barriers must be adequately delineated with raised retroreflective pavement markers (RRPMs) complying with AS 1906.3 or temporary RRPMs (flaps) with retroreflective tape (class 1A minimum) to ensure road users are aware of their presence.\nThe Pavement Markers providing delineation must be located on top of or on the traffic side of the barriers (< 300mm from the top), spaced at \u226412 m intervals along the barrier. Where used on curves with a radius up to 200 m the spacing must be reduced to 6 m on the outside of the curve.\nThe retroreflector or tape may either be yellow double sided* on all barrier applications or the following colours may be used:\na) Single sided red on barriers installed on the left-hand shoulder or verge.\nb) Single sided yellow on barriers installed in the median of a divided road\nc) Double sided yellow where the barrier is positioned in between opposing direction of travel and delineator is placed on the top of the barrier\nd) Single sided white on barriers installed between lanes in the same direction of travel (rare scenario).\n* The use of all yellow retroreflectors must be risk assessed prior to deployment, particularly on 2-way single carriageway applications.\nNote: the above does not replace the need to provide temporary delineation of the travelled path in accordance with AS1742.3. This temporary barrier delineation is considered a replacement for guide post delineation where the location of the barrier is close enough to the edge of the road.\nTemporary Pavement Markers Material Specifications:\n- Extrusion. Polyurethane, 80 shore A\n- Cover. PVC Flexible. Clear.\nFor further details on specifications for the adhesive and reflectivity properties of the Temporary Pavement Markers, see Main Roads Specification 604, located on the Main Roads website at www.mainroads.wa.gov.au; go to \u2018Technical & Commercial\u2019 > \u2018Tender Preparation\u2019 > \u2018Specifications\u2019 > \u2018600 Series \u2013 Traffic Facilities\u2019",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
