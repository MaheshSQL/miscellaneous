            "text": "Prior to commencing works, approval must be obtained from the agency responsible for the care, control and management of the relevant roads. Care should also be taken to ensure that all other required authorisations are obtained prior to the commencement of works. These might include agreement to any variations to the application of this Code of Practice and/or AGTTM / Australian Standards, as well as any development, heritage, environmental, and cultural clearances. Lengthy delays may be experienced if all necessary approvals are not obtained, increasing the risk of undesired traffic incidents.\n\nIn addition to obtaining approval to work within the road reserve from the relevant Road Authority, other agencies such as emergency services, Police, public transport etc. in the area may need to be notified in advance of the impending works as detailed in section 4.4.\n\nAll approvals to conduct works on roads issued by Main Roads, local governments or other Authorities responsible for roads, must be suitably noted on the Traffic Management Plan. A mandatory condition requiring traffic management to be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this Code, subject to any agreed variations, must be included with the approval.\n\nCoordination of adjacent worksites to minimise impacts on road users must be considered prior to approval. Approved implementation times for Traffic Management Plans and/or Traffic Guidance Schemes are generally based on traffic capacity. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, no devices are permitted to close traffic lanes prior to the approved start time and all lanes must be reopened to traffic at or prior to the approved finish time.",
