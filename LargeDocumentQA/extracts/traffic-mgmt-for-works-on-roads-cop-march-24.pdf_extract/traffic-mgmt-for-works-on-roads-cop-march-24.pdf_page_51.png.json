WA has not adopted the method for estimating end of queue position or positioning of the PREPARE TO STOP, Traffic Controller (Symbolic), Signals Ahead or Boom Barrier signs within section 4.8 of AGTTM Part 3. As per section 5.10 in AGTTM Part 3, Traffic control refers to all methods of traffic control including by portable traffic control devices (e.g. portable traffic signals or boom barriers) or by manual traffic controllers. No form of traffic control is permitted on any Freeway or grade separated highways with: \u2022 a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or more; and \u2022 a traffic volume of 20,000 vpd or more. AGTTM Part 2: Traffic Management Planning indicates that inadequate vertical alignment is a potential risk associated with accommodating truck traffic and over-sized loads. In particular, the vertical alignment must be considered when proposing a location to stop vehicles as this may impact both safety and level of service: \u2022 Downgrade: steep downgrades increase the stopping distance of heavy vehicles which increases the risk of high severity end of queue collisions \u2022 Upgrade: stopping heavy vehicles at locations with an upgrade may result in the stopped vehicle rolling back as well as impacting the time for the vehicle to accelerate from the stopped position.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
