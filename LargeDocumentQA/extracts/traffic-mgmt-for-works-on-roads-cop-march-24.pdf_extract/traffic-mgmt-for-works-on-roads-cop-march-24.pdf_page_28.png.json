However, in regional areas that do not have access to RTMs based within 200km of the site, RTMs may endorse complex TMPs without the need to undertake a site visit when all the following criteria is met:\n\n\u2022 The works associated with the TMP will be completed in less than 5 shifts (5 days).\n\u2022 The TMP does not include any risks that have a residual risk rating of High or greater,\n\u2022 The TMP does not involve Temporary Road Safety Barriers,\n\u2022 A person with AWTM accreditation undertakes a site visit after they have consulted with the RTM to determine what information is required (video, photos, measurements, etc.).\n\nIt is important that the RTM collects and maintains photographic and video evidence provided by the AWTM undertaking the site visit. Regardless of the above, a Road Authority / Authorised Body reserves the right to request that an RTM undertakes a site visit in person, in accordance with the RTM Code of Conduct.",

It is the responsibility of the RTM to ensure the TMP contains adequate barrier detail. Where temporary barriers are required, these must be designed in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s requirements, Austroads and Main Roads technical guidelines. Calculations must be appended to the TMP.\n\nTGSs must provide sufficient detail so that installers can determine offset from traffic lanes, worksite length/width, deflection distances required, containment fences (if required), start and finish points of the barrier, flare rates (if any) and necessary end treatments. Temporary barriers must be rated at the appropriate test level and be an approved barrier type listed on the Main Roads Website (Go to www.mainroads.wa.gov.au \u2018Technical & Commercial\u2019 > \u2018Technical Library\u2019 > \u2018Road & Traffic Engineering\u2019 > \u2018Roadside Items\u2019 > \u2018List of Approved Road Safety Barrier Systems\u2019).\n\nWhere temporary barriers are required, implementation methods should be detailed in the TMP and TGSs should be prepared.",
