            "text": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The likelihood of an event or hazard occurring must first be assessed over the duration of the activity (i.e. \u201cperiod of exposure\u201d). For risk assessment purposes the assessed likelihood must then be proportioned for a \u201cperiod of exposure\u201d of one year. Example: An activity has a duration of 6 weeks (i.e. \u201cperiod of exposure\u201d = 6 weeks). The event or hazard being considered is assessed as likely to occur once every 20 times the activity occurs (i.e. likelihood or frequency = 1 event/20 times activity occurs = 0.05 times per activity). Assessed annual likelihood or frequency = 0.05 times per activity x 52 weeks/6 weeks = 0.4 times per year. Assessed likelihood = Possible.",

It emphasizes the importance of safety for both road users and workers, detailing the responsibilities of various authorities and the necessary procedures for implementing Traffic Management Plans (TMPs). The document includes specific requirements for temporary signage, traffic control devices, and risk management, as well as the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) and other safety measures. It also outlines accreditation requirements for traffic management personnel and provides detailed inventories and application schedules for various road signs.",
