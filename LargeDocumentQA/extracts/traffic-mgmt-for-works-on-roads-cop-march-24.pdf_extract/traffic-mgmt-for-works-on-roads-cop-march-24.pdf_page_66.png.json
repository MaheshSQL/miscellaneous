It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
