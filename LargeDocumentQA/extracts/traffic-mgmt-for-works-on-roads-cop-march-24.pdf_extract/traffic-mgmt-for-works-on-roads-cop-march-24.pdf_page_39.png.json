            "text": "Prior to undertaking any works that impact on bicycle paths this Code and AGTTM require these works to be planned to ensure cyclist safety whilst minimising disruption and inconvenience. Bicycle paths should be provided with the same scale and width as existing facilities. However, it is acknowledged that sometimes when conducting short term maintenance works on shared paths and bicycle paths it may not be practical to provide a surface that is suitable for all bicycles. In the first instance other warning signs to warn riders of the surface condition and the need to reduce speed must be displayed. As a last resort, where cyclists cannot physically traverse the surface, the CYCLISTS DISMOUNT sign may be used. Therefore, any use of the CYCLIST DISMOUNT sign will only be for short durations and with the approval of the relevant road authority. Note: The inappropriate use of this sign will result in riders failing to dismount where instructed.",
