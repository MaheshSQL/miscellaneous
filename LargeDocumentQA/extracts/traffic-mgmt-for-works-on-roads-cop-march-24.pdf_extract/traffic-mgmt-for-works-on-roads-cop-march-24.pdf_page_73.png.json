The primary purpose is to make drivers aware of their speed and encourage them to reduce their speed through the worksite. Research indicates that these are very effective in reducing drivers speed for short term purposes.\n\nSpeeds above the speed limit must not be displayed on the sign, i.e. just a message, such as SLOW DOWN, should be shown.\n\nSpeed feedback signs must be used at static worksites on Main Roads\u2019 roads when all the following apply:\n\u2022 Traffic is travelling past or through the worksite (as defined in AGTTM Part 3)\n\u2022 Workers on foot are not protected by a road safety barrier; and\n\u2022 Works conducted at the location for a duration of 8 hours or more; and\n\u2022 Traffic volume of 15,000 vpd (AADT) or more; and\n\u2022 There is a temporary speed reduction of 30 km/h or more\n\nAbove does not apply when there are more than 2 lanes of traffic open in a single direction where speed feedback signs are not recommended.\n\nThe speed feedback display does not have to be displayed at all times e.g. the display may be turned off and the device used to gather speed data when trialling other speed control measures.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
