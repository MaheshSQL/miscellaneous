Covering the road marking can be done with sticker products available from most sign makers. The colour of the sticker selected must be similar to colour of the road surface. Long-term work sites should use the grinding and reinstatement method OR undertake routine inspection and maintenance on the stickers. Where not possible to cover arrow pavement marking, lane status signs must be provided that depict the permitted movements under the TGS.",

It includes standards for personnel competency, traffic management plans, risk management, and the use of traffic control devices. The document details specific requirements for signage, safety audits, and procedures for handling roadworks near sensitive areas. It also outlines the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators, shadow vehicles, and innovative traffic control devices, along with accreditation requirements for traffic management roles. Additionally, it provides an inventory and application schedule for various road signs used by Main Roads Western Australia.",
