            "text": "This is expected behavior. First there's no guarantee that every recent event was part of the model's training data. And even when information was part of the training data, without using additional techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to help ground the model's responses there's always a chance of ungrounded responses occurring. Both Azure OpenAI's use your data feature and Bing Chat use Azure OpenAI models combined with Retrieval Augmented Generation to help further ground model responses.\n\nThe frequency that a given piece of information appeared in the training data can also impact the likelihood that the model will respond in a certain way.\n\nAsking the latest GPT-4 Turbo Preview model about something that changed more recently like \"Who is the prime minister of New Zealand?\", is likely to result in the fabricated response Jacinda Ardern. However, asking the model \"When did Jacinda Ardern step down as prime minister?\" Tends to yield an accurate response which demonstrates training data knowledge going to at least January of 2023.\n\nSo while it is possible to probe the model with questions to guess its training data knowledge cutoff, the model's page is the best place to check a model's knowledge cutoff.",

    "document_summary": "The document is a comprehensive FAQ for Azure OpenAI Service, addressing data privacy, API headers, model support, and capabilities. It clarifies that customer data is not used to retrain models and supports the latest GPT-4 models, including GPT-4 Turbo with Vision for image-related tasks. The document provides guidance on fine-tuning models, deploying with REST API, and handling common errors. It also covers data storage, encryption, usage policies, costs, and geographical data storage specifics, along with responsible AI practices and the Azure OpenAI on your data feature.",
