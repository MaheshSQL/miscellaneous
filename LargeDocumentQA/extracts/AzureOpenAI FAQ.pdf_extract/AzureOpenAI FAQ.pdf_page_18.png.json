If the subject of the claim is Output Content generated from the Azure OpenAI Service (or any other Covered Product that allows customers to configure the safety systems), then to receive coverage, customer must have implemented all mitigations required by the Azure OpenAI Service documentation in the offering that delivered the Output Content. The required mitigations are documented here and updated on an ongoing basis. For new services, features, models, or use cases, new CCC requirements will be posted and take effect at or following the launch of such service, feature, model, or use case. Otherwise, customers will have six months from the time of publication to implement new mitigations to maintain coverage under the CCC. If a customer tenders a claim, the customer will be required to demonstrate compliance with the relevant requirements. These mitigations are required for Covered Products that allow customers to configure the safety systems, including Azure OpenAI Service; they do not impact coverage for customers using other Covered Products.",
