It clarifies that customer data is not used to retrain models and supports the latest GPT-4 models, including GPT-4 Turbo with Vision for image-related tasks. The document provides guidance on fine-tuning models, deploying with REST API, and handling common errors. It also covers data storage, encryption, usage policies, costs, and geographical data storage specifics, along with responsible AI practices and the Azure OpenAI on your data feature.",
