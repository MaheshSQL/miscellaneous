Common examples of this are, a 400 error due to a content filter or input limit, or a 408 error due to a timeout. Charges will also occur when a status 200 is received with a finish_reason of content_filter. In this case the prompt did not have any issues, but the completion generated by the model was detected to violate the content filtering rules, which result in the completion being filtered. If the service doesn't perform processing, you won't be charged. For example, a 401 error due to authentication or a 429 error due to exceeding the Rate Limit.",
