It isn't that close to Downtown, but you can take the tube at Aldgate East which takes you to the city centre. The hotel is clean and the staff mostly friendly. However, we didn't like the bathroom, it was to small! With 3 ladies and everybody has to get dressed this wasn't so much fun. Furthermore, the hotel is located directly on a street, which is noisy also in the night. I had to sleep with my earplugs because even if the window was closed, the room was still noisy!Nevertheless, I would recommend the hotel because it wasn't that expensive and you can be Downtown in a short time.

Breakfast was also good with a excellent choice of fare. Very good value for money, every other hotel was asking for double the nightly rate that we paid. We paid �75 each including breakfast."

It isn't that close to Downtown, but you can take the tube at Aldgate East which takes you to the city centre. The hotel is clean and the staff mostly friendly. However, we didn't like the bathroom, it was to small! With 3 ladies and everybody has to get dressed this wasn't so much fun. Furthermore, the hotel is located directly on a street, which is noisy also in the night. I had to sleep with my earplugs because even if the window was closed, the room was still noisy!Nevertheless, I would recommend the hotel because it wasn't that expensive and you can be Downtown in a short time.

After being a little dubious reading other reviews we were not sure what to expect. However, our room was on the top floor and was modern bright airy and very comfortable, had everything we wanted. I think maybe it's their best room (600) as is was on the corner and had dual aspect windows. We never heard any night club...didn't even know it existed. Breakfast was also good with a excellent choice of fare. Very good value for money, every other hotel was asking for double the nightly rate that we paid. We paid �75 each including breakfast.",

His room was on the third floor which obviously hasn't been refurbished yet and looked rather 'tired', especially the bathroom, but everything was clean. Our room was at the top of the hotel which was obviously the new extension and was quite contemporary. The bathroom was quite small and functional but with a lack of shelving for toiletries etc. but lovely white fluffy towels. The beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets but no extra pillows provided. Again, nowhere in the room to put cosmetics, toiletries etc and it could benefit from a chest of drawers or similar.The rate we paid did not include breakfast but there was a special rate of �7.95 each (usually �9.95) if we ordered and paid for breakfast on arrival. This we did and it was very good value for money. There was a hot and cold buffet with a good choice of dishes and there is no excuse for anyone going hungry. Another bonus is the secure, on site car park, although there is an additional charge for this but it is worth it .The views from the front bedroom windows leave a lot to be desired but we weren't there for the view and the hotel is well placed, being 2 minutes from Aldgate underground station and only 10 minutes walk from The Tower of London and Tower Bridge.We felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel late at night.All in all this is a very good city hotel and although the full room rate could be considered high for this type of hotel in this run down location, there are always discounted rates to be found and I doubt that anyone actually pays the full rate.

The hotel was lovely in the reception area and when we were issued with the room key i was thinking to myself here we go, But once again i have to say the rooms were beautiful and clean, they seemed to be doing all the rooms up and to be honest i think we were the first in this room after it had been decorated. we had air con and a 32 inch lcd tv on the wall, 1 double bed and a single bed (room 418 by the way). bathroom was decorated nicely and it was clean and all facillities worked. rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels every day as well. food in the lane bar was a bit expensive but when you walk out the front door there is plenty of resturants either side of brick lane, (hope you like indian food as there is plenty of those resturants as well.) we stayed for four nights and really enjoyed every moment in london, as i said before aldgate east tube station right beside you so you have no worries about walking far to get anywhere. will defiently be back to london again and would reccomend this hotel to anyone.

But it turned out quite all right after we checked in, except one really HUGE turn off-- the toilet didn't work and the gaga couldn't be flushed down. The porter was quite helpful and finally made the toilet work again. But it's really the number one scary hotel scene in my life. It was not noisy at all in our room and no party downstairs. But the soundproof of the wall was not good therefore we could hear the banging sound of door slamming of our neighbors the the second night when they checked in. The TV in the room did not work at all, so we ended up sleeping early and saved our energies for sightseeing the whole day time. The good thing about this hotel is it's location and the cleanness. It's very close to Aldgate East station so it's very easy to go around London city by tube. I appreciate the cleanness the hotel staff did their best to maintain, however I think the best way to give it an overall upgrade is to renovate its rooms. Many comments here say the best of this hotel is its cheap price. But I ended up paying more through expedia.com. I suggest people avoid the booking system of expedia since I find the price fluctuation can be very tricky. The internet is cheap and convenient (compared to that of Comfort Inn we stay for the last two nights in London). So, overall, I think this will be a good hotel if you're a frugal student on budget with a bunch of friends to have a good time in London. But if you're a couple, the hotel could kill the romantic aura quite instantly.....",

But it turned out quite all right after we checked in, except one really HUGE turn off-- the toilet didn't work and the gaga couldn't be flushed down. The porter was quite helpful and finally made the toilet work again. But it's really the number one scary hotel scene in my life. It was not noisy at all in our room and no party downstairs. But the soundproof of the wall was not good therefore we could hear the banging sound of door slamming of our neighbors the the second night when they checked in. The TV in the room did not work at all, so we ended up sleeping early and saved our energies for sightseeing the whole day time. The good thing about this hotel is it's location and the cleanness. It's very close to Aldgate East station so it's very easy to go around London city by tube. I appreciate the cleanness the hotel staff did their best to maintain, however I think the best way to give it an overall upgrade is to renovate its rooms. Many comments here say the best of this hotel is its cheap price. But I ended up paying more through expedia.com. I suggest people avoid the booking system of expedia since I find the price fluctuation can be very tricky. The internet is cheap and convenient (compared to that of Comfort Inn we stay for the last two nights in London). So, overall, I think this will be a good hotel if you're a frugal student on budget with a bunch of friends to have a good time in London. But if you're a couple, the hotel could kill the romantic aura quite instantly.....",

It was my first time in London and I knew that the hotels are very expensive. We didn't want to spend a fortune on the hotel, that's why we decided to stay in the City Hotel. It isn't that close to Downtown, but you can take the tube at Aldgate East which takes you to the city centre. The hotel is clean and the staff mostly friendly. However, we didn't like the bathroom, it was to small! With 3 ladies and everybody has to get dressed this wasn't so much fun. Furthermore, the hotel is located directly on a street, which is noisy also in the night. I had to sleep with my earplugs because even if the window was closed, the room was still noisy!Nevertheless, I would recommend the hotel because it wasn't that expensive and you can be Downtown in a short time. Don't expect luxury, after all it's a 3-star hotel. If you don't stay that much in your hotel room and just come here to sleep, you will like this hotel!",

They all helped us to celebrate a daughter's 30th birthday in style with many special touches. The cocktail lounge had a good buzz. The restaurant served wonderful Asian fusion food with dishes to please any taste. It was all served beautifully and tasted even better. The rooms varied in decor from traditional to loft-type cool and were clean and well equipped. We were in walking district of Brick Lane, Columbia Road flower market and Spitalfields Market which were all great fun on the Sunday. A great place to stay.",

After being a little dubious reading other reviews we were not sure what to expect. However, our room was on the top floor and was modern bright airy and very comfortable, had everything we wanted. I think maybe it's their best room (600) as is was on the corner and had dual aspect windows. We never heard any night club...didn't even know it existed. Breakfast was also good with a excellent choice of fare. Very good value for money, every other hotel was asking for double the nightly rate that we paid. We paid �75 each including breakfast.",

I read about the nightclub on this website and thought the complaints were exaggerated...they aren't. In fact, I quickly asked the front desk about the degree to which the nightclub would disturb us and was told we would not be affected. It was pretty loud. The plumming is a bit rough, too. The room is of decent size and the hotel is located very close to the Aldgate-East metro station. The Tower of London is a few blocks away. The area itself is blue collar and is filled with ethnic businesses and restaurants. Some of them looked tasty!I think I paid about 65 pounds a night and wish i would have spent more for a better hotel.",

We arrived by car and my heart sank when we turned the corner into Osborne Street and saw the hotel but once inside I forgot how run down the street looked. The reception was welcoming with friendly staff and booking-in took a matter of minutes. We'd booked two rooms, one for me and my husband and one for our son. His room was on the third floor which obviously hasn't been refurbished yet and looked rather 'tired', especially the bathroom, but everything was clean. Our room was at the top of the hotel which was obviously the new extension and was quite contemporary. The bathroom was quite small and functional but with a lack of shelving for toiletries etc. but lovely white fluffy towels. The beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets but no extra pillows provided. Again, nowhere in the room to put cosmetics, toiletries etc and it could benefit from a chest of drawers or similar.The rate we paid did not include breakfast but there was a special rate of �7.95 each (usually �9.95) if we ordered and paid for breakfast on arrival. This we did and it was very good value for money. There was a hot and cold buffet with a good choice of dishes and there is no excuse for anyone going hungry. Another bonus is the secure, on site car park, although there is an additional charge for this but it is worth it .The views from the front bedroom windows leave a lot to be desired but we weren't there for the view and the hotel is well placed, being 2 minutes from Aldgate underground station and only 10 minutes walk from The Tower of London and Tower Bridge.We felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel late at night.All in all this is a very good city hotel and although the full room rate could be considered high for this type of hotel in this run down location, there are always discounted rates to be found and I doubt that anyone actually pays the full rate. We paid �59 per room (+ breakfast) which was an absolute bargain for a London hotel.Would definitely stay again without hesitation.",

The room was larger than expected, bright and airy and there was a large flat screen tv. However, the beds were very uncomfortable - don't come here if you need a good nights sleep. Pillows and mattress were rock hard, and the air con and fridge made strange noises all through the night. Also, don't be tempted to eat in the restaurant by the claims that you get 50% off food and 20% off drinks. Me and my boyfriend are both students so dont have a lot of money, being told that as hotel guests we would get money off encouraged us to go into the hotel restaurant. However, after ordering food and drinks, one of the waiters came over with the bill, saying that we could not get 50% off, and also did not take the 20% off the drinks. There is also a &quot;service charge&quot; which he explained was a charge that every table had to pay for the waiters to get the food from the bar kitchen. But this was a RESTAURANT, the waiters are expected to bring you your food surely?. He expected a tip as well as the service charge. In the end he took the service charge off the bill, but not the 20% and 50% off the food and drinks. So we ended up paying a lot of money for the things we ordered - the food was ridiculously overpriced. Would not be surprised if he kept the money that he should have taken off our food and drink for himself as his tip.The location was not that great. Was only a couple of minutes walk from Aldgate East tube station, but I didnt feel very safe walking just this short distance to the hotel.Would not recommend",

Lovely comfy bed, big T.V. fridge, bathroom...all spotlessly clean. No problem with the toilet. Towels etc changed daily. Breakfast is available in the hotel, but there are lots of coffee shops in the area if that is your preference. Lots of interesting places to eat in the area as well, not just in Brick Lane but around the Spitalfields market area too. The nearest tube is about one minute away and it is also possible to walk to the Tower of London area. Thought this was a great place to stay, it was good value and good location.",

My mind was put to rest as soon as I walked into reception and had a warm welcome. Checking in took just a few minutes, whilst sharing a joke with the clerk. I was soon outside my room door and hesitantly put my key card in and opened the door....to a large, clean, modern room. LCD TV on the wall..a double and single bed (all for just me!) and even today's paper, with the latest editions of two well known magazines left out.Heading down to the trendy bar I relaxed in comfort before heading back to my room and fell asleep on the comfy bed.I rang down to reception to get my room safe opened and within minutes the maintenance guy was at my door and very professionally showed me how to operate it. I felt safe at all times in this hotel and found the service was extremely pleasant and good natured.Some people have commented that the surrounding area is not as safe as some areas. I would not really agree, the area IS very blue collar but so long as you follow the same rules for personal safety as you would anywhere you will be fine. The tube station (Aldgate East) is literally a one minute walk away. In fact, I think the area has much more to offer in terms of diversity than other more mainstream areas of London. If you like curry you'll be spoilt for choice. I have to say that I love my curry and head the best curry of my life (and a free drink!) at one of the restaurants on brick lane.",

The hotel was lovely in the reception area and when we were issued with the room key i was thinking to myself here we go, But once again i have to say the rooms were beautiful and clean, they seemed to be doing all the rooms up and to be honest i think we were the first in this room after it had been decorated. we had air con and a 32 inch lcd tv on the wall, 1 double bed and a single bed (room 418 by the way). bathroom was decorated nicely and it was clean and all facillities worked. rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels every day as well. food in the lane bar was a bit expensive but when you walk out the front door there is plenty of resturants either side of brick lane, (hope you like indian food as there is plenty of those resturants as well.) we stayed for four nights and really enjoyed every moment in london, as i said before aldgate east tube station right beside you so you have no worries about walking far to get anywhere. will defiently be back to london again and would reccomend this hotel to anyone. Hope this will put your mind at ease as other reviews can be very worring. Have a nice stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

But each one of them were right as I could see it for myself during our stay. I still went through the booking as my 65 year old parents wont have to walk a lot to get to the tube station nearby.The location is Blue Collar filled with bangladeshi restaurants and some were good others looked like it needed a cleanup. Our room was on the second floor and since we booked on weekdays none of the DJ music downstairs disturbed us. Although there was this teenager who used to stop by the restaurant downstairs everynight blarring loud music in his car. I really wanted to call the police as it was so annoying. I realised I cant expect that area to be perfect. I could see the Ibis just nearby and god I wished I stayed there. The three days we stayed there the service was teribble. With the exception of a plumber who was so nice to speak to and guided us about the local transportation, he came to repair our toilet which as you have already read in other reviews was not working. The reception staff were the well mannered but looked like they were going to jump on you any minute and we felt like we wereint welcome to ask anything else except to pay them. Although the bar downstairs was not a problem to us, everything during our 3 day stay were filled with issues. If you could afford a little bit more stay at the Ibis which is very close to this hotel.",

But it turned out quite all right after we checked in, except one really HUGE turn off-- the toilet didn't work and the gaga couldn't be flushed down. The porter was quite helpful and finally made the toilet work again. But it's really the number one scary hotel scene in my life. It was not noisy at all in our room and no party downstairs. But the soundproof of the wall was not good therefore we could hear the banging sound of door slamming of our neighbors the the second night when they checked in. The TV in the room did not work at all, so we ended up sleeping early and saved our energies for sightseeing the whole day time. The good thing about this hotel is it's location and the cleanness. It's very close to Aldgate East station so it's very easy to go around London city by tube. I appreciate the cleanness the hotel staff did their best to maintain, however I think the best way to give it an overall upgrade is to renovate its rooms. Many comments here say the best of this hotel is its cheap price. But I ended up paying more through expedia.com. I suggest people avoid the booking system of expedia since I find the price fluctuation can be very tricky. The internet is cheap and convenient (compared to that of Comfort Inn we stay for the last two nights in London). So, overall, I think this will be a good hotel if you're a frugal student on budget with a bunch of friends to have a good time in London. But if you're a couple, the hotel could kill the romantic aura quite instantly.....",

An absolute disaster from start to finish.Do not be deceived by the richly elongated photos. It is a cramped and scruffy place.Arriving on friday evening we were told by an unhappy staff member that we had to pay in advance. No reason or exclamation. Fair enough, in some places that happens. We paid up and went to the bedroom. At the time the place was being refurbished but it was impossible to tell which parts had been refurbished and which hadnt. The place was so dirty even the mice wore overalls.The rooms had a laminate floor finish, curling at the corners. They were just unnattractive but reasonably clean. We were told that breakfast would be served in the bar the next morning so we turned up and had an inedible breakfast among the upturned tables and chairs.On the saturday night we thought we'd have a few drinks in the bar but were told at the street entrance of the bar that there was a &quot;Private Party&quot; that we had to pay �10 or �15 each cover charge (cant remember which). We said we were residents and were told we still had to pay. On asking reception they didnt want to know. The bar had been advertised as one of the place's best features. Throughout the whole weekend we never heard a single comment about anything from any staff member. On monday morning on checking out I let the staff know of my grievances, but was answered with 3 blank stares. No explanation or apology except to say that the bar was reserved for a party by the owners son. Not one staff member even identified themselves or took any responsibility for everyone. The place was completely devoid of atmosphere. The rooms were furnished with family size fridges, abviously for DSS residents but that wouldnt be a problem if the place at least pretended to be a hotel. Please dont waste your money. its depressing",

The hotel is in a bit of a rough area, its not too bad but as a woman i wouldnt feel safe walking around alone in that area at night. It had a tesco metro about 2mins walk away and tube was 5mins walk. Ideally placed if you want to be close to all the touristy things but you dont want to pay central london hotel places.

I personally love the area, though overseas visitors may find it a bit tatty. With a tube station (Aldgate East) just round the corner, there's no need to splash out for a West End hotel. And at the end of the evening you can take advantage of the excellent choice of curry houses in Brick Lane and saunter back to your bed.The rooms themselves are surprisingly spacious considering the built-up surrounding area.

On phoning, I found the staff to be very hard to understand, and it was very difficult to make myself understood. After a few minutes trying to get the staff to realise what I wanted, I decided to give up and book in person instead the next day when I would be in the area. As a native english speaker, I don't think it's too difficult to expect the phone to be answered by someone who is capable of communicating with me effectively!I turned up the next day, and I expected the communication difficulties would be easily resolved in person. Sadly, I was completely mistaken. The same problems continued. After a ten minute conversation, where I attempted to get the staff to perform the simple task of booking a room for me in two weeks time, I became increasingly frustrated. They didn't seem to grasp the idea that, no, I didn't want a room tonight, I want it in 2 weeks time! These communication difficulties could easily have been sorted out had the staff not become even more frustrated with me than I was with them. I tried my hardest to be as polite and patient as possible, but they were very rude and I got the impression from them that they basically couldn't be bothered. In the end I just left without making the booking, because I simply couldn't afford to waste any more of my time! I decided to stay somewhere else in the end!City Hotel is probably a very nice place to stay, but god knows how anyone can manage to actually make a booking",

Terrible management and rooms. I spent two-night in City Hotel in May. It is by far the worst hotel I�ve ever stayed. I checked in the hotel after 11pm and just wanted to relax, but nothing in the room worked, and I was not able to sleep until 1am. The TV remote control was not functioning and TV itself�s channel button were all gone. I called reception desk. The guy came up, did something and an image showed up. He said �see it works� as if I didn�t know how to use a TV. It turned out the remote control was not working and one had to enter a specific channel number (if you know which channel is working) to change channels. Then no hot water came out of the shower. I had to call again, waited, the first person came didn�t know what the problem is and the second one was able to fix the show knob, but again said �see it works� as if I didn�t know how to operate shower. Not only I wasted all my time, but I was insulted.The next day I was in a rash to get to a place but not sure where exactly it is on the map, so I asked the reception desk on my way out. Big mistake. The guy did something in front of his company for 10 minutes and still had no answer for me. When I asked what happened since I was in a hurry, the manager stepped out of his office and told me �we don�t provide this service.� No wonder the hotel has so many problems, just look at what kind of manager the hotel has. When I asked anybody for direction on London streets, they were all very happy to help. However, the manager in this hotel doesn�t seem to know he is in hospitality and service business.",

We arrived by car and my heart sank when we turned the corner into Osborne Street and saw the hotel but once inside I forgot how run down the street looked. The reception was welcoming with friendly staff and booking-in took a matter of minutes. We'd booked two rooms, one for me and my husband and one for our son. His room was on the third floor which obviously hasn't been refurbished yet and looked rather 'tired', especially the bathroom, but everything was clean. Our room was at the top of the hotel which was obviously the new extension and was quite contemporary. The bathroom was quite small and functional but with a lack of shelving for toiletries etc. but lovely white fluffy towels.

We arrived by car and my heart sank when we turned the corner into Osborne Street and saw the hotel but once inside I forgot how run down the street looked. The reception was welcoming with friendly staff and booking-in took a matter of minutes. We'd booked two rooms, one for me and my husband and one for our son. His room was on the third floor which obviously hasn't been refurbished yet and looked rather 'tired', especially the bathroom, but everything was clean. Our room was at the top of the hotel which was obviously the new extension and was quite contemporary. The bathroom was quite small and functional but with a lack of shelving for toiletries etc. but lovely white fluffy towels. The beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets but no extra pillows provided.
